"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Facing criticism over his inexperience and ability, the Trump ally avoided interviews and debates while coasting to victory in Alabama Tommy Tuberville did not respond for comment. The next U.S. senator from Alabama has stuck with that avoidance strategy, as he’s dodged interviews, debates, and—his critics say—the issues, on his way to winning the 2020 senate election. Tuberville—a former college football coach who is mostly remembered in Alabama for leading Auburn University to an undefeated 2004 season—helped kick off the 2020 election results with what an easy win for the Republican Party, by most accounts. But it’s Tuberville’s political inexperience, fumbled answers on basic policy throughout the campaign, and his campaign’s subsequent decision to clam up and trust Alabama voters will simply vote “Republican” that has led to a wave of criticism against the loyal incoming Trump lawmaker. In one of his few public statements in June, Tubervilledescribedhimself to voters as a “salesman.” What he’s selling, though, is uncertain. “Tuberville campaigns in North Alabama, avoids public speaking and interview requests,” a local CBS 19 in Huntsville, Alabamareportedthree weeks ago. “His entire candidacy is prefaced on just supporting what the president does,” veteran Alabama political consultant David MowerytoldCNBC, pointing out Tuberville’s apparent plan to shut the windows and ride off the coattails of the president. Alabama is seen as a political stronghold for the GOP party, having not elected a Democratic senator prior to Tuberville’s incumbent opponent since 1990 before the “Republican Revolution” of the mid-90s. RELATED:Trump Leaves Supporters Stranded in Cold — Again — After Georgia Rally Sen. Doug Jones, the Democratic lawmaker Tuberville unseated on Tuesday, had won a special run-off election in 2018 after former Sen. Jeff Sessions took on the role of U.S. Attorney General under President Donald Trump. Jones had won the 2018 special election by a narrow 21,000-vote margin, after a number of women alleged in a Washington Postreportthat his Republican opponent, Roy Moore, had sexually assaulted them when he was in his 30s. One of the women was 14 years old at the time. Alabama has been reliably red for decades, not having voted for a Democratic president since 1976 and not having elected a Democratic governor since 1998. Tuberville, 66, moved to the state from Florida in 2018 with the intention of running for the senate in 2020, Alabama news site Yellow Hammerreported. Sessions, 73, had also returned to the state to try and reclaim his old senate seat, which he held from 1997-2017. Both he and Tuberville aligned themselves with Trump in the primaries, though Trump, 74, backed the former coach instead of his former attorney general, who he long held personal disdain for since Sessions recused himself from the Robert Mueller investigation in early 2017. Trump lobbed criticism at his former attorney general, portraying him as mentally unfit, saying he’s “a disaster who has let us all down. We don't want him back in Washington!\" Tubervillehandedly won the state primaryover Sessions, who \"fought back tears” as he conceded the race. Tuberville, with the president’s endorsement, coasted through the general election against Sen. Jones, ignoring interview requests and declining to debate his Democratic opponent. Despite mounting reports about his political inexperience and his refusal to defend himself, mostpollsshowed Tuberville with a commanding double-digit lead heading into Election Day. “[Jones] can do everything right, he can run a great campaign, and he’s still likely to lose,” American University political professor David LubintoldCNBC.

One player called his candidacy “disingenuous” and called his candidacy “a power grab.” “President Trump has no interest in Black males,” said Tommy Jackson, who played on Tuberville’s undefeated Auburn team. “For Coach Tuberville to support someone like that—what does that say about somebody who has always thought this way to make millions of dollars off the same people the president is intending to overlook or mistreat? It’s shameful. It’s downright shameful.” RELATED:How People Are Making It Easier to Vote, From Free Rides to Free Food at the Polls But, Tuberville managed to win over voters by fiercely aligning himself with both the president and conservative ideologies, telling a campaign crowd on Sunday that he believes God actually helped put Trump in office. “I’ve said this several times.

In his divorce petition, Hernandez requested a restraining order against De La Cruz, but sought to remain in the couple's home with his daughter. Hernandez cited \"cruel treatment\" by De La Cruz towards him and his daughter from a previous relationship, who is a minor. He described an incident between his wife and daughter after the girl was in tears over coffee spilled at church. \"Rather than try to console her,\" Hernandez said, referring to the crying girl, De La Cruz \"took her to the bathroom and pinched her to get her to stop crying.\" De La Cruz has denied that she ever mistreated Hernandez's child.

Salinas said what's unfolding in divorce court \"may work in her favor because it showed her ability to stay calm cool and collected under pressure.\" Court records show that De La Cruz was upset that her husband has held on to a pair of dogs: a Chihuahua mix named Dallas and a Shih Tzu named Austin. In her response to Hernandez's divorce petition, De La Cruz's attorney said her husband \"intentionally or recklessly engaged in a pattern of extreme and outrageous conduct\" that caused \"severe emotional distress\" by refusing to release the dogs to De La Cruz and other children. Dallas and Austin are registered emotional support animals, according to certificates that were submitted to the court, which also name Hernandez's daughter as their owner. But De La Cruz has claimed in the document that the dogs are \"beloved pets\" of De La Cruz and her children.

The officer states De La Cruz said she believed Hernandez was trying to \"instigate a rise out of her\" while recording video of her as he and his sister followed her around their home, asking her why she was drunk. She usually ignores the behavior, De La Cruz said, but told the officer, \"She felt they went too far and she felt afraid of him,\" according to the police report.

Secretary of education’s 163-foot yacht, Seaquest, was untied from the dock at the Huron Boat Basin in Ohio on Sunday and crashed into the dock, according to a police report obtained by theToledo Blade. Huron Police Chief Bob Lippert did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment. The captain of the yacht was who called the police and reported that he had discovered someone had purposely untied the Seaquest from the dock, the report said. He and his crew were able to regain control of the ship, but not before it crashed into the dock. Damages to the boat are estimated to be between $5,000 and $10,000, according to the report. Lippert toldCNNthe yacht belonged to DeVos’ family and that the secretary of education was not in Huron, Ohio when the incident occurred. Lippert told the outlet police were working to get video surveillance of what took place. The Seaquest is just one of 10 boats owned by the DeVos family, according toABC News.

Five of the eight album of the year nominees for 2019 are women. It’s a particularly momentous time for rapperCardi B, who is nominated for a total of five awards, including the coveted album of the year title. Country darlingsKacey MusgravesandMaren Morriswere able to transcend their genre by earning nods in the album of the year and record of the year categories, respectively, while folk rocker (and critical favorite)Brandi Carlileearned a total of six nominations, including nods for album, record and song of the year.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Travel restrictions for Americans visiting Cuban had been loosened under President Obama Cruising to Cuba is off the itinerary following a new ban issued by the Trump administration. Anannouncementfrom the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday restricts tourist travel to the Caribbean island. The news has cruise lines, airlines and others scrambling to amend their offerings and accommodate customers who’ve already booked travel to the country. Restrictions for Americans traveling to Cuba had previously been loosened under President Obama. “Cuba continues to play a destabilizing role in the Western Hemisphere, providing a communist foothold in the region and propping up U.S. adversaries in places like Venezuela and Nicaragua by fomenting instability, undermining the rule of law, and suppressing democratic processes,” Munchin said in his statement. He continues: “This Administration has made a strategic decision to reverse the loosening of sanctions and other restrictions on the Cuban regime. These actions will help to keep U.S. dollars out of the hands of Cuban military, intelligence, and security services.” RELATED: What It’s Really Like to Go on a Jon Bon Jovi Cruise: One PEOPLE Editor’s Journey Carnival Corporations, the parent company of Carnival Cruise Line noted they are “required to cancel our visit to Havana,” due to the ban, which is “effective immediately.” They will replace planned stops in Havana with another port of call. Some Carnival guests are already a aboard a June 3rd sailing, which was intended to dock in Havana, but will be rerouted to Cozumel, Mexico, instead. “We recognize Havana is a unique destination and may have been the reason for the selection of this itinerary.  Along with our apologies, guests will receive a $100 onboard credit posted to their Sail & Sign® Account,” the line announced in a statement. Virgin Voyages, a new adults-only cruise line founded by billionaire Richard Branson, was planning to set sail to Cuba in 2020 and has already accepted bookings. In a statement to PEOPLE a representative for the company said, “While we are disappointed, the beauty of sea travel means that we have the flexibility to take our ships to many wonderful destinations. The Virgin Voyages crew is hard at work making necessary adjustments to any affected sailings that feature a stop in Cuba next year.” They will announce adjusted itineraries next week. Virgin’s policy allows passengers to change the dates of their voyage without penalty, so Cuba-bound travelers can rebook. RELATED VIDEO:  479 Cruise Passengers Airlifted to Safety After Mayday as ‘Chaos’ Aboard Ship Goes Viral Online Erica Silverstein, Senior Editor at Cruise Critic, told PEOPLE how both cruise lines and travelers are handling this latest policy change. “The most pressing, time-sensitive question we’re hearing from travelers is what do the new restrictions mean for cruisers who already have booked (and in some cases, paid for) their cruise to Cuba?” Silverstein said. “Cruise lines are often able to swap itineraries relatively quickly,” she said.  “We’re already seeing cruise lines make itinerary changes to sailings in the very near future where a call at a Cuban port was part of a wider Caribbean itinerary.” However, she notes, “For Cuba-focused cruises, where Cuba is the sole destination, it’s possible that cruise lines may replace the itinerary entirely.” Any travelers who were hoping to visit Cuba, should check the State Department website for updates, according to Tracy Stewart, content editor of travel deal site Airfarewatchdog. RELATED: We Tried It: I Went on a Disney Cruise Without Any Kids — and It Was Magical! “You’d also be wise to purchase travel insurance. A ‘cancel for any reason’ policy may not be the cheapest option but can really save the day should you have to call off your trip at the last minute for any reason.” While travel to Cuba was made more accessible duringBarack Obama‘s time in the White House, it has become increasingly restrictive since Trump took office in 2017. Obama also reestablished diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba after more than 50 years in 2014, calling the restrictions that had been in place “an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests.” In November 2017, new rules ensured visits were only allowed as part of people-to-people educational programs traveling under the supervision of a U.S. entity. This is eliminated under the latest policy change.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

He added, \"Enjoy your families and stay healthy, my friends.\" Johnson's Father's Day breakfast with Jasmine was extra special in 2020 because it involved homemade pancakes ... that Jasmine then proceeded to eat herself. And so is his youngest daughter, Tia. Johnson has tried and tried (to no avail) to get his youngest daughter, Tia, to believe that he is the voice behindMoana's Maui. He even sings his song \"You're Welcome\" to her over and over and over again. But Tia \"refuses to believe that urban legend that her daddy is actually Maui. At this rate,\" he added, \"it's even pure speculation that her dad is also The Rock.\" But it doesn't matter to Johnson, who wrote, \"I'll happily take these L's and laugh as long as I get my daddy/daughter bond.\" When 4-year-old Jazzy asked her dad to hold onto the piñata so that she could take a swing, Johnson didn't think twice about the consequences. \"The sacrifices fathers are willing to make,\" he wrote, joking, \"Candy and sterility all in one swing. 😂🤦🏽‍♂️\" Name something cuter than The Rock himself teaching his daughter Tia that she is a \"pretty, awesome, smart girl\" who can \"do anything.\" Johnson captioned a photo of himself with his daughter Jasmine, \"Blessed, strong and the world will hear from you one day.\" Even professional wrestlers take a beat down once in a while. Sometimes, it's from their own kids! Nothing to see here, just The Rock, sitting in a tiny chair at a tiny table having a spot of tea with his daughter, Jasmine. He admitted, \"Daddy may have put a little nip of tequila in his tea, cos it's always 5 o'clock somewhere.\" Jasmine's favorite game is to have her dad pour her water, only to take the water, look at her dad and dump it out onto a towel. He doesn't mind, though, if it means getting to hear his little girl laugh! \"And then your babies graduate,\" Johnson captioned a photo of himself with his daughter Simone as she graduated from high school. \"Very proud of my first daughter graduating high school, kickin’ ass and is now NYU bound.\" He concluded, \"I love you and one day you’ll stop pulling away from my beastly arms & kisses 😘🦍\" The actor and former Sexiest Man Alive has no problem helping his kiddos find Easter eggs that \"Easter Daddy, I mean Easter Bunny\" hid. Baby Tiana knows she has her dad wrapped around her little fingers. In a sweet photo commemorating Tiana's 1st birthday, Johnson wrote, \"Get used to daddy's hands kid ~ they'll always have your back.\" Like who is more handsome and intelligent, Dada or former president Barack Obama? \"I ain’t gonna be able to hold ‘em like this forever, so you better believe I snatch these cookies and love ‘em up every moment I can,\" Johnson wrote on Instagram alongside a sweet photo of him with both Tiana and Jasmine in his arms. \"Plus, I know there’s gonna come a day where in daddy’s arms is the last place they want to be,\" he added, pointing out, \"Baby Tiana Gia is already there with the 'help me' look on her face 😂🤦🏽‍♂️\" He finished his caption, \"Can’t guarantee I’ll love and protect all my daughters for the rest of their lives, but I can guarantee I will for the rest of mine.\" He knows his girls are the boss, and, \"As much as I tell her no, with my crazy busy life, this is the stuff I actually love.\" Who doesn't love to get pampered? \"I'll lead ponies for our weekly backyard lessons,\" Johnson wrote alongside a photo of him serving as Jasmine's \"Shotgun Rider.\" Johnson even accompanied his eldest daughter, Simone, to a Fifth Harmony concert in 2017, scoring backstage access, of course.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Trump recorded and released a video message from the White House Rose Garden while the riot was underway on Capitol Hill, urging the mob to disperse and telling his supporters, \"We love you. You're very special.\" Much of Thursday's hearing was dedicated to presenting evidence ofwhat Trump did and didn't do in the 187 minutesbefore he finally called off the attack, after hours of pleas from his inner circle and others at the Capitol and elsewhere to do so. \"I know your pain, I know you're hurt,\" Trump said in the footage that was eventually released. \"But you have to go home now, we have to have peace. We have to have law and order, we have to respect our great people in law and order.\" RELATED:187 Minutes: Jan. 6 Witnesses Describe What Trump Did — and Didn't Do — While Riot Raged at Capitol The next day he recorded another video from inside the White House. Outtakes of both videos were shown during the hearing on Thursday. \"The staff that remained at the White House on Jan. 7 knew the president needed to address the nation again and they had a speech prepared for him that morning. But he refused for hours to give it,\" Rep. Elaine Luria, a Virginia Democrat and former Navy officer who sits on the Jan. 6 panel, said at Thursday's hearing. RELATED:Footage Shows Josh Hawley Running From the Capitol as Trump Supporters Descended on the Building Luria said the committee heard testimony that Trump was finally convinced to deliver the message later in the evening of Jan. 7 by advisors who warned of \"concerns he might be removed from power under the 25th Amendment or by impeachment.\" The outtakes, Luria said, were taken more than 24 hours after the video filmed in the White House Rose Garden. After a few takes, Trump is seen saying, \"This election is now over. Congress has certified the results,\" before stopping himself and saying on camera, \"I don't want to say the election is over. I just want to say Congress has certified the results without saying the election is over, okay?\" RELATED:Mike Pence's Secret Service Detail Was 'Making Calls to Say Goodbye' as Mob Approached: Official His daughter and former senior advisor,Ivanka Trump, can be heard off camera coaching the president on the precise words to say in the video. In a later moment of footage, Trump stumbles over the word \"yesterday\" and asks for it to be taken out of the prepared remarks. In another shown during the hearing, he smacks the presidential podium while repeating the line: \"My only goal was to secure the integrity of the vote.\" Thursday marked the last in a series of televised hearings the committee scheduled this summer.

DeMille Awardduring Sunday’s Golden Globes, the actress used her time on stage to call out President-elect Donald Trump, though she avoided mentioning him by name. Streep spoke of the importance of empathy in today’s world and referenced the moment that Trump mockedNew York Timesreporter Serge Kovaleski during a rally in 2015 for his disability. “This instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in thee public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing,” Streep said. “Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.” She then highlighted the importance of the press: “We need the principled press to hold power to account, to call them on the carpet for every outrage. That’s why our Founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in our Constitution.” Immediately following Streep’s powerful speech, Hollywood stars such as Ellen DeGeneres, Anna Kendrick, and Laverne Cox posted praise for the 30-time Golden Globes nominee online.

Some of the information in this story may have changed after publication. For the latest on COVID-19, readers are encouraged to use online resources fromCDC,WHO, andlocal public health departmentsand visit ourcoronavirus hub. Health experts are weighing in amid rumors that ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory medication may worsen the infection of the novelcoronavirus (COVID-19). On Saturday, France’s Health Minister Olivier Vérantweetedthat “taking anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, cortisone, …) could be a factor in worsening the infection” in regard to the coronavirus and urged those with a fever to take paracetamol, or Tylenol, instead. “If you are already on anti-inflammatory drugs or in doubt, ask your doctor for advice,” Véran added. But as it turns out, Véran’s advice might not be as factual as expected. According to Dr. Robert A. Norton, a professor of Public Health at Auburn University, and Dr. William Haseltine, infectious disease expert and Chair and President of the global health think tank, ACCESS Health, there are no current data that prove taking ibuprofen can make the virus worse. RELATED: U.S. Cases of Coronavirus Near 4,000: Here’s an Updated Map of the Spread “I have not seen any data on this,” Norton tells PEOPLE. “The high fever that is associated with the virus is medically serious. High fever can be life-threatening.” “Individuals experiencing high fever need to immediately contact their medical provider and assiduously follow their guidance,” he continues. “In addition to medication, people experiencing high fever can apply cold compresses to their bodies.” Norton explains that the compresses are often used in hospitals to help patients cope with high fevers and that medical personnel occasionally use ones that circulate cold water and “rapidly bring down core temperature.” “Having said that, I want to emphasize I am NOT saying that cold compresses are an acceptable substitution for medication,” he adds. “Only a licensed physician can give guidance on medication.” Haseltine echoed his sentiments, noting that he hasn’t seen any data on the topic and it would require multiple controlled studies in order to determine the drug’s effect on patients. “The only way you can know that is through a controlled study,” he says. “You can suspect it, but unless you actually do a controlled study on people given an inflammatory and those who aren’t, you can’t tell.” Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, naproxen and ibuprofen, have been known to potentially suppress one’s immune system, according to a 2015 study called“Possible Immunosuppressive Effects of Drug Exposure and Environmental and Nutritional Effects on Infection and Vaccination.“ “In addition to their anti-inflammatory function they often may have also complex immunological effects on cell proliferation, migration, antibody, and cytokine production,” the report states, adding that NSAIDs have been shown to interfere with antiviral immune functions influencing the duration of viral shedding.” Though certain illnesses, such as a cold, likely won’t pose a threat to a person’s health if their immune system is compromised, those with coronavirus cannot risk that and will need to be as healthy as possible so their body can effectively fight off the infectious illness, Dr. Amir Khan toldAl Jazeera.

I hope allows us to catch up to the projected pace that we had spoken about a month or two ago when we were talking about the planned roll-out of the vaccinations.\" \"Because we really wanna get those priority people vaccinated so that we can then get to what we call the open season for the general population,\" he added. \"Because once you do that — I mean, what we're doing now is certainly saving lives, no doubt about that — but when you get to the point where you can essentially say anybody and everybody who wants to be vaccinated can be vaccinated, that's when you really turn around the dynamics of the outbreak.\" RELATED:President-Elect Joe Biden Decries Trump's Vaccine Rollout: It's 'Not Progressing as It Should' Speaking withCNN, Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association, noted three major reasons for issues surrounding the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine: vaccine supply, inadequate infrastructure and communication.

The proposal includes a provision that also prohibits schools from \"adopting procedures or student support forms that require school district personnel to withhold from a parent specified information.\" Critics worry the language could force educators and administrators to \"out\" students who might be afraid of disclosing their sexuality or gender identity at home. The rules and regulations around what teachers can and should bring up in the classroom have become increasingly politicized in recent months, with some conservative lawmakers responding with legislation like that in Florida. \"This will kill kids,\" Buttigieg, 32,said on Twitterof the proposed bill.

Since Winchester died in 1922, the home has hosted tours for those willing to walk among the Winchester ghosts, and inspired the new filmWinchesterstarring Helen Mirren. For those looking for a less spooky reason for the house’s mysterious design, thepodcast99% Invisibleposited the theory that Winchester simply loved architecture and had the room to add on and on without tearing it down first. A form of this article originally appeared onTravel + Leisure. Back in 1852, James “Yankee Jim” Robinson was hung by his neck for the crime of grand larceny. A few years later, Thomas and Anna Whaleybuilt a houseon the spot where Robinson died and soon enough, Yankee Jim’s ghost showed up, haunting the site. It's said his footsteps can be heard clumping around the house. Yankee Jim isn’t the only specter, though—both Mr. and Mrs. Whaley, a young girl, and even the family dog have been known to make appearances from beyond the grave. The house is so thoroughly spooky that,according toTIME, in the 1960s, the U.S. Commerce Department classified the Whaley House as haunted. New York’s Greenwich Village has some of the most desirable real estate in the world—save for one brownstone on West 10th Street. Known as “The House of Death,”the townhouse is said to be haunted by the ghosts of 22 people who lived or died within its walls, including that of a six-year-old girl beaten to death by her adopted father. Being New York City, however, the house has a celebrity pedigree, too. It’s said that author Mark Twain stayed in the house back in 1900 and returns for the occasional visit. The house’s haunted history is documented in author Jan Bryant Bartell’s “Spindrift Spray from a Psychic Sea,” which recounts her experiences living in the building’s top floor apartment. Back in 1892, Andrew and Abby Borden were found dead—killed by an axe-wielding psychopath. The police’s number one suspect was Andrew’s daughter, Lizzie. Lizzie stood trial for her crimes and was ultimately acquitted, but she spent the rest of her life under the shadow of guilt. She is now said to haunt the Fall River, Mass., home where her father and stepmother were murdered, and her ghost is said to laugh at the top of the home’s stairs. The house is now amuseumand bed & breakfast (outfitted with ghost cams) where stalwart guests can spend the night listening for Lizzie’s ghost or that of her murdered parents, and listen for the echoes of the maid’s screams after she found the dead in their bed. If that’s not gruesome enough, visit the Lizzie Borden House in August when the museum stages their annual re-enactment of the gory crimes on the anniversary of the murders. The small Iowa town of Villisca (population 1,252) doesn’t have much to offer tourists, except for a night of terror at theVillisca Axe House.In a story straight out of Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood\" back in 1912, the white wood frame house was the site of a horrifying crime that left an entire family, including their four children and their two young friends, killed by the swings of an axe. There were severalsuspects, including an Iowa state senator, but no one was ever charged with the bloody crime. Over 100 years later, their ghosts are said to remain at the house, yearning for justice. Visitors eager for a taste of the supernatural can book tours of the site, while the bravest can spend the night and see what goes bump. Anyone who watched \"American Horror Story: Coven\" will recognize the infamous New Orleans home called LaLaurie House. The stately French Quarter home belonged to the blood-thirsty Madame Delphine LaLaurie, whose perfectly appointed home hid a dark secret—a torture chamber for slaves. The list ofher ghastly crimesis long, and if anyone deserved to be haunted, it was LaLaurie. Her victims are said to haunt the property to this day, and while tours of the house aren’t available, passersby on the street have claimed to hear ghostly moans, screams, and weeping. Some say they have seen ghostly faces from the upstairs windows, too. It’s no wonder that the house was vacant for years, until actor Nicolas Cage bought it. He soon lost it to foreclosure, and the Royal Street mansion sat vacant again, until a new owner bought the property, remodeling it and having itblessed by a priestbefore moving in. In the early 1800s, John Bell bought a tract of farm land along Tennessee’s Red River. Bell and his family thrived on the farm until the family started to see strange looking animals around the property, most notably a dog with a rabbit’s head. From that point onward, the family was beset upon by unseen forces, largely targeted at Bell himself, as well as his daughter Betsy. They experienced physical attacks, heard unexplained noises, and even spoke with the “entity,” who, in at leastone account, identified herself as the Bells’ former neighbor, Kate Batts, exacting revenge for some unknown slight from beyond the grave. The entity is rumored to have prevented Betsy’s marriage to a local boy and is believed to have killed John. According to oneBell Witch website, the haunting is backed by plenty of evidence, including “eyewitness accounts, affidavits, and manuscripts penned by those who experienced the haunting first hand.” Today visitors can tour the Bell Witch’s cave and a reconstruction of the Bell’s cabin or come to Adams for the annualBell Witch Festival, held on Halloween, of course. The most famous haunted house in the United States is undoubtedly this stately waterfront home on New York’s Long Island. While the movie \"Amityville Horror\" was based on the house’s dark history, its reality is scarier than anything Hollywood could dream up. It all started back in 1974, when, for reasons unknown, Ronald DeFeo, Jr. shot and killed his mother, father, two sisters, and two brothers while they slept. He was sentenced to life in prison, despite arguing that voices in the hometold him to do it. With its owners dead or in jail, the house was put up for sale and a couple with three young children bought the place. They regretted it almost instantly. They heard strange noises, felt a chill in the air, had swarms of flies invade the house, cloven pig hoofs appeared in the snow, a marching band was heard tuning up, and the young daughter developed a scary imaginary friend. A priest was unable to exorcise the spirit,and the family moved out just 28 days later. The house was putup for saleagain in June, buyer beware. The White House may be home to presidents, but it is also rumored to house many illustrious ghosts within its storied walls. PresidentRonald Reagan reportedlyentertained dinner party guests with stories of his dog barking at invisible specters and his daughter, Maureen, waking to a transparent figure looking out the window of the Lincoln bedroom. It may have been President Lincoln himself, returning to his former home in the hopes of reuniting with his wife or son, Willie. British Prime Minister Winston Churchillreportedlyencountered Lincoln’s ghost too, while he was stepping out of the bathtub. Abraham Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd, held séances in the White House, according toMental Floss, in hopes of contacting their son, Willie, who died of typhoid, presumably fromcontaminated waterpumped into the White House. They never contacted their son, but they did claim to get in touch with President Andrew Jackson, loitering in his former bedroom. According to theWhite House History site, President Harrison, the first president to die in the White House, continues his stay there. It’s not just former presidents who haunt the halls of the highest office in the land—Dolley Madison, wife of James Madison, is said to visit the gardens she helped plant, and Abigail Adams, wife of John Adams, is known to do her laundry in the East Room.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

In a post shared to his own network Truth Social on March 18, the politicianclaimed that his indictmentby the Manhattan District Attorney is imminent, suggesting that he may be arrested as early as Tuesday this week. The investigation involves an alleged $130,000 \"hush money\" payment made to adult film starStormy Danielswhile he was a presidential candidate in 2016. Trump said in the post thathe could soon face possible criminal chargesrelating to the allegation, in reference to reports from various outlets, including theAssociated PressandCBS. \"Illegal leaks from a corrupt & highly political Manhattan district attorney's office ... indicate that, with no crime being able to be proven ... the far & away leading Republican candidate & former president of the United States of America, will be arrested on Tuesday of next week,\" wrote Trump (in reference to himself) on the site over the weekend. In addition to his claim, Trump — who is running for president in 2024 — called (in all capital letters) for followers to \"protest, take our nation back.\" Though Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office is leading the criminal investigation, has not publicly responded to Trump's claims, several of Trump's spokespersons — including Joseph Tacopina, his lawyer — have released statements on behalf of Trump. TheD.A.'s office previously invited Trump to testifybefore the grand jury as part of its criminal investigation into his alleged role in the hush money payment, though Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels and has condemned the investigation. Here's everything to know about Trump's ongoing criminal investigation, including what could happen if he is indicted. Daniels (née Stephanie Clifford) is an adult film star andcurrently the hostofOUTtv'sFor the Love of DILFs. She gained notoriety for detailing hermultipleallegedsexual encounterswith Trump in a shelved2011 interview withIn Touchmagazine. Daniels told the outlet that the then-real estate mogul-turned reality star allegedly invited her to his hotel room for dinner after meeting at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe in July 2006. She claimed she and Trump had \"textbook generic\" sex that night, and had several more sexual encounters in the months that followed. The alleged sexual encounter supposedly took place less than four months after Trump's wife and former-First LadyMelaniagave birth to their son,Barron. After theWall Street Journalreported that money might have been exchanged to keep Daniels from making her story public, theIn Touchinterview came to light in full. Since then, thealleged extramarital affairand illegal payments are part of a years-long saga involving various players, in addition to Trump and Daniels. Michael Cohen is Trump's former personal attorney and a key witness in the case investigating the alleged hush money paid to the adult film personality. That is because Cohen admitted to helping arrange the payment to Daniels (and former Playboy modelKaren McDougal) andpleaded guiltyto federal campaign finance violations in August 2018. Trump and Cohen initially denied the allegations; prior to Cohen pleading guilty,he toldThe New York Timesthat he paid Daniels $130,000 out of his own pocketas a \"private transaction\" in 2016. He said Trump had not reimbursed him. Trump has since admitted he authorized the $130,000 payment, but hascontinued to deny the underlying claimsthat the two had an affair or that the payment was in any way connected to his campaign. (TheWSJreported that thehush money payment was arranged to Danielsa month before the 2016 election so she'd keep quiet about an alleged sexual encounter.) \"Mr. Trump's business concealed the true purpose of the payments, the filing said, by recording them ashaving been for a legal retainerthat did not exist,\" reported theNew York Times, citing a2018 federal court filingin Cohen's case. Cohen pleaded guiltyin 2018 to tax evasion and campaign finance crimes in connection with the payment to Daniels andwas sentencedto three years in prison. He was also disbarred. Meanwhile, Danielslost a defamation lawsuitagainst Trump after he denied her claims. Trumpcould face chargesfor falsifying business records when he allegedly reimbursed his then-personal attorney Cohen for paying off Daniels. \"The hush-money deal, allegedly crafted weeks before his presidential win, could also put Trump in jeopardy of violating campaign finance laws,\"Timereports. The components of the investigation create a complicated case that is not clear-cut. While hush money schemes are not illegal,the record for Trump's reimbursement to Cohen says it was for legal fees, which would be falsifying business records. This is a misdemeanor — a criminal offense — in New York. Furthermore, prosecutors could potentially claim that the motivation behind Trump's alleged attempt at hiding his payments to Daniels was fueled by not wanting voters to know he had an affair with her. \"Covering up a crime by falsifying records would be a felony, which is a more serious charge,\" reported the BBC. There have been several failed attempts to charge politicians with crossing the line between campaign finance and personal spending — and according to Catherine Christian (former financial prosecutor for the N.Y.C. D.A.), this case is\"going to be tough.\" Despite Trump's claims on Truth Social that his arrest is expected on March 21, D.A. Bragg is the only person who can decide whether an indictment will be announced. He set up a grand jury and isscheduled to meet on March 20 in a Lower Manhattan courtto determine whether there is enough evidence to pursue charges in a case. Robert Costello, Cohen's former legal advisor, isexpected to testify before the New York grand juryon March 20 at the request of Trump's lawyers. TheNew York Timeswas the first to report the news, according to sources with knowledge of the matter. Joseph Tacopina, previously spoke with CNBC and said that Trump willsurrender to face criminal charges, should he be indicted. \"[He] will follow normal procedures if it gets to that point,\" Tacopina told the outlet on March 17. This includes being booked into jail, in addition to getting his fingerprint and a mugshot taken. While it's still too early for a judge to determine Trump's sentence if convicted, prison time is a possibility. \"The charge of falsifying business records in the first degree is a low-level felonycarrying up to four years in prison,\" NBC News reports. Absence of a criminal recordis not listed in the U.S. Constitutionas a qualification for presidency. It states that those considering candidacy are required to be a natural-born citizen of the U.S. who are at least 35 years old and have been a resident of the country for 14 years. Therefore, Trump — who is is actively seeking the Republican nomination for the White House in the 2024 presidential election — could still be elected president, regardless of whether he is criminally indicted. \"Some people are surprised to learn that there's no constitutional bar on a felon running for president, but there's no such bar,\" said Kate Shaw, ABC News legal analyst and professor at Cardozo School of Law. As for whether Trump has plans to stay in the presidential race even if he were to be criminally indicted?\"Absolutely,\"he said at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in early March. \"I wouldn't even think about leaving,\" Trump told reporters ahead of his speech. \"Probably it will enhance my numbers.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Preparations forthe 2018 Winter Olympicsin South Korea have had their share of challenges — political as well as ticket- and weather-related — but officials say the doubts cast by headlines are not reflected on the ground. “We’re pretty confident,” Nancy Park, an international media spokeswoman for the PyeongChang Organizing Committee, tells PEOPLE. Park notes that the International Olympic Committee and other organizations have reviewed the preparations and “overall, no one has ever questioned that we’ll be ready.” “Every day, we know when we need to be ready,” she says, adding, “The world is watching.” February’s Games will mark the first Winter Olympics in Asia in 20 years, and organizers are touting it as the “largest and most compact” Winter Games. Organizers tell PEOPLE the total budget for the 2018 Olympics, including infrastructure and operations, is estimated at approximately $12.6 billion dollars, a fraction of the 2014 Games’ reported cost. With less than two months to go, Park says with a laugh, “It’s really busy in the office.” Here’s what you need to know. The 2018 Winter Olympics will be held in Pyeongchang, a popular hiking and skiing location more than 100 miles east of Seoul, the capital, and about 50 miles from the North Korean border. The competitions will be largely grouped into two “clusters,” one in the mountains and one on South Korea’s east coast. After previous failed bids, Pyeongchang — which is distinguished by its little “c” from references to the Olympics, when the “c” is capitalized — beat out locations in France and Germany for the 2018 Games. Park tells PEOPLE that of the 12 competition venues for the Games, six are new and six are pre-existing, with some modifications. Four of the new venues are completely done, she says, and two are nearly done. All 12 venues are within a 30-minute drive of the Olympic Stadium, which was finished in September, according to Park and thePyeongChang official website. What’s more, says Park, 80 percent of athletes can get to their venues in 10 minutes. And for the first time at a Winter Olympics, there will be more than 100 medaling events (102 to be exact, with new events such as big air snowboarding). “In terms of all the hardware, infrastructures, all of that, that is done,” Park says. “So for us as the organizing committee right now, we’re working on the final touches.” With competitors and media arriving in January, Park says organizers are comfortable that all of the hardware is done and now it’s a matter of details such wallpaper and stocking toiletries as well as stress-testing. Even so, she acknowledges there will be inevitable daily hiccups. However, in terms of readiness, Park says they have multiple inspections going on all the time. The IOC declined to provide an official for an interview with PEOPLE but pointed toa news release late last monthtouting South Korea’s Olympic readiness. As of mid-December, ticket sales were at about 55 percent, according to Park. But she says enthusiasm has increased as the Games draw closer. At the 100-days mark, the Olympic torch relay began, and with it, “ticket sales have started to increase,” Park says. “It’s done a lot to really bring a lot of excitement to the Games throughout Korea,” she says. The changing weather also draws attention to the Games, she says (though not always in a positive way, as detailed below). According to Reuters,578,000 tickets had been soldas of Dec. 5, about 54 percent of the goal. That is in line with previous Olympics, an organizing official said. South Korean officials are hoping for more than a million total spectators, about a third of them from other countries,the Associated Press reports. An organizing committee document reviewed by Reuters showed a key concern with the PyeongChang Olympic Stadium: The 35,000 spectator seat arena venue doesn’t have a roof even as temperatures in early February are reportedly expected to feel about 7 degrees, factoring in wind-chill. According to Reuters, the stadium was built roof-less due to cost and concerns about whether a roof was structurally supportable, even as PyeongChang officials had lobbied otherwise. (A presidential spokesperson declined to comment to Reuters.) In November, six people at a concert in the stadium said they got hypothermia, Reuters reported, citing other outlets. “These are stopgap measures,” Shim Ki-joon, a top politician who works to support the Games, told the news agency. “This is a very serious issue,” he said. “This is creating a headache to not only the organizers but the presidential office, which sent officials to the venue to figure out ways to fight the cold.” “It is not something we have not encountered in the past,” the IOC’s Olympic Games Executive Director Christophe Dubi reportedly said at a news conference last week. “[Organizers] have installed windscreens and [provided] blankets and there will be plenty of information,” Dubi also said. “In the last K-pop concert people were not well informed of how cold it could get.” The organizing committee document seen by Reuters reportedly shows plans to provide blankets and hot packs to spectators and as well as shortening security wait times and using audience participation activities to help warm them up. Park confirmed such plans to PEOPLE, saying organizers plan to “distribute a ‘kit’ that consists of a blanket and hot packs to help against the cold to each spectator that attends. We will also set up wind nets to block the wind which have proven to be successful, as well as installing additional heaters around the stadium for people to go to if necessary.” “We hosted a concert at the stadium a month ago, and what we learned was that the most important element is public information,” she says. “We will be informing attendees that they should be dressed warmly as it will be colder, since the ceremony will be held in the evening.” As to the question of why a roof was not constructed, Park says the decision was made after a feasibility study and because the stadium is a temporary venue. Much of the attention in America has focused on what North Koreamay or may not do during the Winter Games. And while Park acknowledges these concerns, she notes that, for South Koreans, it’s “like business as usual.” “We’ve been living with this political tension for 60 years,” she says. “In general if you come to Korea and talk to the average Korean it’s like, ‘Oh yeah, I’m kind of aware of it, but I still have to pay my bills, go shopping.’ “It’s really a non-issue for an average Korean, but we know the international community has concerns … there is a lot being done.” Among the efforts being made, Park cites work with more than a dozen domestic agencies, including South Korea’s defense ministry. More distracting this year and last for locals, Park says,has been a scandalinvolving former South Korean President Park Geun-hye, whowas impeached in Decemberand removed from office in March over her longtime connections to Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of a cult leader, who was suspected of using her influence over the president for personal gain. Park says that once there was a new election and a new president — Moon Jae-in this past spring — people were able to move forward. Park adds that President Moon is “one of the biggest promoters of the Games.” With the political distractions seemingly resolved, attention can now turn to the Olympics, Park says.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Bloomberg, the 77-year-old former New York City mayor and billionaire founder of an eponymous business news company, launched his campaign in November, nearly a year after the rest of the Democratic field of candidates and only months before voting in the primary began. RELATED:Michael Douglas Makes First Public Appearance at Mike Bloomberg Event Since Father Kirk’s Death Taylor has spent the last few months campaigning alongside Bloomberg, at his side or as his surrogate. An experienced businesswoman who, like Bloomberg, went from being a Republican to a Democrat, she has appeared at rallies, town hall meetings with potential voters and has done her share of community outreach on the campaign’s behalf, visiting local hospitals and schools. She may be called different things by different people and media outlets —The New York Timesonce described heras Bloomberg’s “quietly glamorous sidekick” and theNew York Postcalled her his“gal pal”— but Taylor’s message has stayed largely the same during her long-term relationship with Bloomberg, through his three terms as mayor to his 2020 campaign. “He is a man of incredible capabilities and resources,” she told thePost. “I’ve always thought that he’d be a really good president.” They first met at a business luncheon in 2000, according to thePost. Later that night, they crossed paths at a restaurant and he asked her to have a drink. She and Bloomberg do not have kids together. “I never had kids because there was never anyone I wanted to have kids with,” she told thePost, calling herself a “sort of a step-whatever for Mike’s [two] children — friend, I guess.” “I define myself first and foremost as I’ve had a fairly successful career,” she said. RELATED:Why Judge Judy Is Endorsing Mike Bloomberg for President Against Donald Trump Taylor appears honest about Bloomberg’s political flaws, too. With his decision to enter the 2020 race, his record has again come under scrutiny — including his past defense of the controversial “stop and frisk” policing policy that disproportionately targeted minorities and, more recently,when the Associated Press reported this weekthat he had seemingly blamed the 2008 housing crisis on anti-discrimination policies. In herPostinterview, Taylor said stop and frisk “was horrible.” “It affected people’s lives in a very negative way,” she said. “But the reason he was doing it was to stop people from being killed.” Taylor, an Ivy League educated advocate with decades of experience working on Wall Street and sitting on financial boards for companies like Citigroup, has often taken on the role of promoting Bloomberg’s ability to lead and run a public office. Even so, longtime friend andVogueeditor Anna Wintour told thePost, “Her famous boyfriend may be the least interesting thing about her.” “She’s intelligent, independent — and completely her own person,” Wintour said. “Michael is lucky to have her.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

It’s changing the2020 presidential race, too. Both leading Democratic candidates, former Vice PresidentJoe Bidenand Vermont Sen.Bernie Sanders, canceled campaign events Tuesday night in Cleveland where each had been set to address supporters following six state primaries taking place around the country that day. On Wednesday night, PresidentDonald Trumpcanceled two upcoming re-election rallies planned for Colorado and Nevada, as health officials recommend that Americans use“social distancing”and avoid large crowds in order to slow the spread of the respiratory virus. “Out of an abundance of caution from the Coronavirus outbreak, the President has decided to cancel his upcoming events in Colorado and Nevada,” the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement to reporters. (The president has not been tested for coronavirus and said earlier this week he feels fine, though he had come in close contact with lawmakers who were exposed to a coronavirus patient.) “All future Bernie 2020 events will be evaluated on a case by case basis,” the Sanders campaign said in a statement Tuesday afternoon, canceling their rally in Cleveland hours before it was set to begin. Biden’s campaign canceled its similar event at nearly the same moment on Tuesday — both cancelations coming after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWinelaid out the state’s plansto reduce large public gatherings to help stop the virus’ spread. “In accordance with guidance from public officials and out of an abundance of caution, our rally in Cleveland, Ohio tonight is cancelled,”saidBiden spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. “We will continue to consult with public health officials and public health guidance and make announcements about future events in the coming days.” Sunday’s Democratic debate also announced changes to reflect coronavirus concerns: It will not have an audience or a media work area. RELATED:Meghan McCain Criticizes Donald Trump for ‘Misinformation’ Amid Coronavirus Outbreak Maryland, a state that has yet to vote in the Democratic primary,is reportedly consideringchanging its election to mail only. Some are even wondering how many other campaign events might be canceled, including major gatherings such as the Democratic and Republican National Conventions which are scheduled for this summer. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said this week that, for now, he’s not considering canceling the mid-July event in Milwaukee and instead holding an online rally — which would mean thousands of delegates would have to cast their votes remotely when deciding whether Biden or Sanders will be the party’s nominee. “We’d have to change the rules,” Pereztold Axios. “We’re not contemplating rule changes.” The Republican National Convention, scheduled for late August in Charlotte, North Carolina, has yet to make an announcement regarding its plans. The RNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday, though Vice President Mike Pencesaidthis week that all of the president’s upcoming 2020 rallies — which have been a signature part of Trump’s campaign efforts — will be contemplated on “a day-to-day basis.” RELATED:Bernie Sanders Admits Joe Biden’s ‘Doing Very Well’ but ‘Strongly’ Disagrees He’s a Better Pick The DNC announced this week that Sunday’s anticipated debate between Biden and Sanders, the first one-on-one debate of the 2020 presidential election, will take place in Phoenix without a live audience. CNN, who is hosting Sunday’s debate,saidthe decision was made “at the request of the campaigns and out of an abundance of caution.” The debate could be one of Sanders’ last chance to swing the Democratic presidential race back in his favor, after leading in the delegate count and national polls for the first month of the race before Biden’s stalling campaign made a dramatic “Super Tuesday” comeback on March 3, winning 10 states and sling-shotting him into the top spot for the potential nomination to run against President Trump in November. “I’m here to report: We are very much alive,” Biden said earlier this month after his “Super Tuesday” wins. “And make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.” As of Thursday morning, there were about 1,280 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S. and 37 people had died, the vast majority of them in Washington state. To prevent the spread of the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages maintaining basic forms of hygiene including careful hand washing, avoiding touching the face, moving away from people who are coughing or sneezing and staying home at signs of illness.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

I grew up in a family with different political views, so I’m very used to that and I’m also very respectful of it,” she said, as reported byHuffpost. “But I’m actually at a point now where if I think that I am interacting with anybody who supports a man who tweets that when there are people who have lost loved ones and who are really sick and people who are still dying because of COVID, then I just don’t really know how I can understand how you can support an individual like that,\" Schwarzenegger Pratt added. \"So, get thinking people.” Sam Elliott TheA Star Is Bornactor lent his iconic voice to Joe Biden’s latest ad, which aired during Game One of the World Series on Oct. 20 - and got a massive reaction on social media. The ad, titled “Go From There,” avoids all mention of President Trump, instead focusing on what unifies us as a nation. “There is only one America,” Elliott begins. “No Democratic rivers, no Republican mountains. Just this great land, and all that’s possible on it, with a fresh start. Cures we can find, futures we can shape, work to reward, dignity to protect.” He continues, “There is so much we can do if we choose to take on problems and not each other and choose a president who brings out our best.

Just to agree we all love this country ― and go from there.” Ariana Grande The pop star, whose \"Positions\" music video sees her in a White House notably led by women, BIPOC and queer folks, shared a roundup of her outfits from the clip on Instagram, encouraging fans to let her know their favorite looks \"and vote for Biden.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Why haven't we done anything about this?\" In response, Biden said, \"I think a lot of it is intimidation by the NRA. This is not your father's Republican Party. This is a MAGA party. It's a very different Republican Party.\" As Kimmel countered about the state of the GOP, he said, \"It seems like the party has moved hard-right, but the people maybe haven't moved hard-right. Because people overwhelmingly believe we should have serious background checks\" — to which the audience applauded. Pointing to the assault weapons ban he sponsored in 1994, Biden said that violence and gun crime dropped in the decade it was in effect — but that things changed for the worse immediately after the Bush administration didn't reauthorize it. \"You could own assault weapons again.

Lyme diseaseis a potentially debilitating infection caused by bacteria called Borrelia burgdorferi and sometimes Borrelia mayonii, and is transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick. While Lyme can be easily treated for some people, for others the disease can cause long-term health issues. According to the CDC, symptoms can include fever, headache, fatigue, and a rash called erythema migrans. However, if left untreated, the infection can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system.

He yelled for his son,Gavin Guffey, who was in the bathroom with the door locked. When the 17-year-old failed to answer, Brandon kicked in the door and found his oldest child lying on the floor, bleeding. \"I'm thinking he fell and hit his head,\" he says. After shouting to his wife, Melissa, to call 911, he noticed a gun lying next to their son. \"I could smell and taste the gunpowder,\" he says. He sat on the bathroom floor with his son's lifeless body cradled in his arms. His son had taken his own life. \"I've never experienced anything like that, that amount of pain,\" he says. \"Still, to this day, it's still very painful.\" Just as searing is when he and his family found out Gavin was being blackmailed over compromising pictures he'd sent a woman he believed was a college student in North Carolina on the night he died. Online scammers posing as the young woman sent the recent high school grad nude photos and asked him to send some in return.

When he pressed send, the scammers threatened to show them to the world unless he forwarded money on online payment apps. \"My son was a target,\" says Brandon, who is working with local and federal authorities to apprehend the scammers he believes are responsible for his son's death. (The FBI declined to comment on the case.) Determined to prevent other kids from falling prey to sextortion, Brandon has turned his grief and pain into action. Brandon was the Republican nominee for the state House of Representatives at the time Gavin died, and last November, he won the general election. In January, his first order of business as one of South Carolina's newest legislators was to introduce a proposal to the state Houseto make sexual extortion a crime punishable by up to 30 years in prison.

He hopes it gets passed in the House this year before legislators adjourn at the end of May. \"This needs to be passed today!\" he says. \"Bills move slowly yet we have a habit of moving some things through quickly. What is more important than saving kids?\" The issue is so critical that in December, theFBI issued a public safety alertsaying that law enforcement had received more than 7,000 reports related to the online sextortion of minors. \"This is a major crime,\" he says. \"But people do not talk about it.\" Victims \"think that they're having this little online relationship only to find out that it's being recorded,\" he says. Knowing the victims are feeling ashamed and embarrassed, \"they use that information to extort them for money, or they're going to release it to everyone that person knows.\" Now he is trying to let as many people as he can know about the dangers of sextortion. \"It's about raising awareness so parents understand that this is a real threat,\" he says. Another way Brandon is spreading the word about the often hushed-up crime is with the heart-shaped symbol of love — Brandon tattooed the symbol on his left arm, put it on t-shirts and on specially-made lapel pins for each legislator who signs his bill. He even had the conversation-starting image put on a tie he wears to the state House. Recently, he says, \"I hop in the elevator with 10 other University of South Carolina sophomore and juniors and they tell me, 'Hey, I really like your tie,'\" he recalls. \"I was also wearing my son's tennis shoes, which were just old Vans that are all drawn-on. [The students] were like, 'You're the coolest one here.' \"I said, \"Well, let me tell you what all this means.' I ended up having them all follow me back to my office and give them a 30-minute lecture on the dangers of sexting and sextortion. \"Everything I do is trying to draw awareness. I would shout it from the mountaintop if I could.\" He is also trying to do what he can to prevent teen suicide, telling kids how important and loved they are. \"The slogan 'Tomorrow Needs You' has become a rallying cry for us,\" he says. He hopes other states take a firmer stance against sextortion and social media sites work harder to prevent the sextortion of minors. \"I want to ensure that these social media companies are held responsible,\" he says. As Brandon fights to protect other families, his own — Melissa and their surviving sons Coen, 16, and Callahan, 4 — miss Gavin every single day. \"He always looked out for everyone,\" says Gavin's brother Coen, 16. \"He was always super nice to everyone.\" Coen is proud of his dad for working so hard to protect other teens. \"He believes it's his calling to help people and prevent it from happening to anyone else.\" If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text \"STRENGTH\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to988lifeline.org.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: \"Courtney Irby's arrest is a disgrace,\" State Senator Andrew Warren wrote on Twitter A Florida woman’s arrest on theft charges for handing the guns of her allegedly abusive husband over to police has become a flashpoint in America’s ongoing gun violence crisis. After their divorce hearing on June 14, Courtney Taylor Irby and her estranged husband got into an argument. She got in her car to drive away and called 911, saying she feared for her life, police wrote in an arrest affidavit for her husband, Joseph Irby,reportsThe Ledger. While on the call, her husband allegedly rear-ended her bumper multiple times, according to the affidavit,LKLDNow.com reports. Joseph Irby, was arrested and charged with a felony charge of aggravated battery,the Associated Press reports. At his bond hearing the next morning, a judge said he wasn’t allowed to own weapons. Courtney knew he had guns, and while he was in jail, she went into his locked apartment and took his pistol and a handgun and then turned them over to the Lakeland Police Department. “She heard a judge say he could not possess the weapons, and she did not trust he would do anything about it,” her attorney Lawrence Shearer toldThe Ledger. In her arrest report, an officer asked the 32-year-old mother of two if she was admitting that she had gone into her husband’s locked apartment and robbed him. “Yes,” she said, in the arrest report documents. “He wasn’t going to turn them in so I am doing it.” The arresting officer called her ex — who was in custody — and her ex said he wanted to press charges. Courtney Taylor Irby was arrested and charged with armed burglary of a dwelling and grand theft of a firearm. She was processed at the same police station where, the day before, she alleged her husband had made 27 harassing phone calls to her. The officer who placed her under arrest was the same one she spoke with the day before. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

In an interview withThe Ledger, Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia said the judge’s order that Joseph Irby not own guns was an “admonishment,” but not a “warrant for us to go into someone’s residence.” “We could have certainly tried to make contact with him and say, ‘We understand you’re under this order from the judge and if you have weapons we’d like you to surrender them,’” Garcia told the paper. “But we weren’t given that opportunity.” Democratic State Rep. Anna Eskamani sent a letter to State Attorney Brian Haas urging him not to prosecute,The Ledgerreports. “Prosecuting Ms. Irby sets a scary precedent that if someone seeks help to escape abuse, they will be punished for it,” Eskamini wrote. Assistant State Attorney Jake Orr tells PEOPLE, “We have received that letter. We certainly will take it into account,” and says the office is reviewing the case. PEOPLE’s calls to the local police and the attorneys of Courtney Taylor Irby and Joseph Irby were not returned. Andrew Warren, a State’s Attorney in nearby Hillsborough County,criticized the arrest on Twitter, writing, “Courtney Irby’s arrest is a disgrace. In @HillsboroughFL, we disarm domestic abusers who have legally forfeited their right to having a gun, and we always stand with survivors — not arrest them.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Gunn tells PEOPLE of his decision to back Bloomberg: \"He’s able to make his priorities known to his constituents, and I also know how well he listens\" WhenTim Gunngot a text from his friendBette Midlerin mid-January asking him how he felt about the2020 presidential raceso far, he didn’t expect the conversation would end with him involved in one of the ongoing campaigns — especially one he didn’t even realize had started. But Midler wanted to know how Gunn felt aboutMike Bloomberg, the billionaire media mogul and former mayor of New York City who in Novemberjumped into the Democratic racenearly a year after the rest of the field. “I said, ‘Is Mike Bloomberg still in the race?’ And [Midler] said, ‘Very much so, and I’m standing up for him,’” Gunn, 66, tells PEOPLE. And so the formerProject Runwayhost — who is launching a new fashion competition series on Amazon this year — began emailing with Bloomberg’s campaign after his conversation with Midler. He officially joined on as a member of Bloomberg’s LGBTQ Leadership Council less than 24 hours ago. RELATED:All the 2020 Presidential Candidate Celebrities Have Supported So Far “When I talked to his campaign yesterday, they said, ‘We’re getting into this late’ and I thought, Maybe that’s a real advantage,” says Gunn. “He hasn’t been part of this squabbling and bickering. Now he can just ride in like a knight in shining armor.” Bloomberg announced his candidacy on Nov. 24, with many seeing his run at the Democratic nomination as a long-shot bid, coming only a few months before the first primary voting begins in February. His allies have pointed to his vast personal wealth as an advantage at getting his name out to voters even as he avoids some of the same primary campaigning his opponents have been engaged in for months. His campaign is also premised, in part, on his hypothetical appeal as a more moderate Democratic against Sens.Bernie SandersandElizabeth Warren. (In an unusual strategy, Bloomberg is avoiding the first four Democratic primary contests and hoping to mount a stronger showing when more states begin voting in March.) The 77-year-old billionaire — who made his fortune through his eponymous financial and news organization — has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars on ad spending across the country and is reportedly willing to spend big to earn a spot on the ticket come November. Recently, Bloomberg joined PresidentDonald Trumpin spending about $10 million on a Super Bowl ad buy. Gunn says he hopes to also help spread the word in backing Bloomberg’s campaign. “I would like to see part of my role being to help people understand who Bloomberg is and that he is in the race, because I would say for the most part they aren’t right now,” Gunn tells PEOPLE. “My own ignorance is a sign of that, I think.” Gunn joins the Bloomberg campaign’s LGBTQ leadership council alongside fellow designerIsaac Mizrahi, Olympic basketball player Gail Marquis and others who will help advocate for Bloomberg and inform voters about Bloomberg’s equal rights policy, which will be announced later Tuesday. RELATED:Who Is Still Running for President in 2020 Bloomberg was N.Y.C.’s mayor from 2002 to 2013. While he has faced heavy criticism for championing a controversial “stop and frisk” policy that disproportionately targeted racial minorities (he since apologized upon announcing his 2020 campaign), Bloomberg is recognized as an LGBTQ ally in helping push for legalizing same-sex marriage in New York state in 2011. “I see the pain that the status quo is causing, and I cannot defend it,” Bloomberg said then, according toThe New York Times. Gunn tells PEOPLE that concern about the danger of the status quo for the LGBTQ community in America is still the case under the Trump administration. “It’s just alarming that we’re in this position, but we are,” says Gunn, noting the Trump rollback of transgender rights, including banning transgender people from serving openly in the military. “Every day brings more shock.” “We need protections for people,” Gunn adds. “It’s still the case that in 31 states you can be fired for being LGBTQ. That’s appalling. Given the current climate of the current administration, they’re doing everything possible to roll back the rights that we even have.” “I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America,” Bloomberg said while announcing his run in November. “We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions.” RELATED:Why Judge Judy Is Endorsing Mike Bloomberg for President Against Donald Trump Designers, gather 'round. I’m on@ProjectRunwaytonight at 9pm ET#makeitwork — Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg)October 14, 2010 With a crowded Democratic presidential field, there are several options for voters in the race to challenge Trump. Gunn says he just didn’t feel excited about any of them. “I was feeling listless and bland about them, but with Bloomberg I actually perk up,” he tells PEOPLE. “It’s just an added bonus when you feel excitement and enthusiasm about a candidate and among the pack he’s the only one I can say that about. Do I like some of them? Yeah. But do they pull at my heart strings? No.” Though Gunn admits: “Part of that is familiarity.” Living in New York for over 30 years and having met Bloomberg twice before — once when the then-mayor appeared onProject Runwayin 2010 — Gunn is partial to the business mogul, someone he knew as a city official for a decade. “Bloomberg was a great mayor. We still miss him. We still invoke his name,” Gunn says, adding, “He’s able to make his priorities known to his constituents, and I also know how well he listens. He’s not a steamroller. To meet him, he is collegial. He’s user friendly. He’s a keen listener and he wants to know what’s on your mind.” Though Gunn’s role in the campaign is still largely undefined, he says he’s “happy to be a sounding board” when it comes to LGBTQ policy. “I’ll do whatever I can within the limits of my own schedule,” Gunn says. “I’m eager to participate and be a cog in the wheel of the solution to the situation we’re currently in.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Feimster, who wore a blue suit, and Smith, who wore a \"beachy\" white dress, exchanged vows in front of a small group of friends, all making sure to follow strict COVID-19 safety precautions. \"I was excited,\" Feimster tells PEOPLE. \"We've been together for five-and-a-half years. If you don't know who you're marrying after five-and-a-half years, then you're in trouble. So I knew it felt good, it felt right.\" Feimsterproposed to Smithin January 2018 during a romantic trip to Big Sur. She says their plan was \"always to get married this summer,\" but the pandemic restricted travel for their guests, as Feimster's family lives in North Carolina and Smith's family is from Michigan. \"It was something small. We only had a couple of good friends there. We all had COVID tests. We purposefully kept it small for the reasons of it being during a pandemic,\" Feimster says. \"We had started [planning] in early March because it was never going to be a traditional wedding, per se. It was going to be more of a celebration, but we were starting to look at venues and stuff, and then COVID hit. So then we were like, 'I guess that big thing is not happening.'\" The comedian adds, \"We just asked a couple of our close friends we knew had been taking the quarantine and pandemic seriously. We only gave them a week's notice. We said, 'Would you guys be willing to take COVID tests and keep hunkering down leading up to the day?' And they were like, 'Absolutely.' So yeah, so we felt good about that. We felt like everybody was being super responsible.\" The U.S. Supreme Court discussions on same-sex marriage played a major role in Feimster and Smith wanting to get married. With theSenate's recent confirmationof President Donald Trump's nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, the court now has a 6-3 conservative majority. \"I'm not going to lie, there were some nerves about the Supreme Court,\" Feimster says. \"After Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, all these people started talking about gay marriage again. On the first day of their session, two of the justices brought up gay marriage. I think I had posted something on Instagram, something like, 'Oh man, this is nerve-racking as a gay person.' Especially because we were planning to get married. All these people were like, 'Go get married now.'\" \"Who knows what will happen? Hopefully, marriage equality is here to stay. But we wanted to be more proactive and get married while we know we can,\" she explains. \"It definitely got the ball rolling for us a lot faster. I mean, we were going to get married no matter what, but we just were like, 'Why wait?'\" Feimster and Smith's Pomeranian rescue, Biggie, was the adorable ring bearer at the wedding. The tiny pooch, who Smith says is \"a little joy,\" was dressed to the nines in a pinstripe tuxedo and tie, to which the wedding bands were fastened. \"They put [Biggie] down to come walk towards us and he gets right towards the edge and he does a big shake,\" Feimster recalls with a laugh. \"And we were like, 'Please still have our rings.' We just envisioned our rings flying off of his tuxedo and into the ocean, but luckily they stayed.\" TheFortune Feimster: Sweet & Saltystar tells PEOPLE they only started to plan their Malibu wedding \"three weeks ago.\" \"We just decided [to do the wedding] because we don't know when [the pandemic] is going to be over and it's just too hard to plan anything. We just did something quick and small with our friends,\" Smith says. \"We had a really great [event planning] company, Missy Fine Inc. She really put all this beautiful stuff together last-minute,\" Feimster adds. \"She [was] amazing. I mean, when Jax and I were planning it, we were like, 'I guess we'll, I don't know, get some roses in a vase and we'll ask our friends to take pictures on their iPhones.' But then we were like, 'No, let's make it special.'\" As Feimster and Smith's families couldn't fly in from out of town, the comedian said they live-streamed the wedding over Zoom on a computer that was set up on a chair in the middle of the patio. \"That one we didn't even plan,\" Feimster says. \"So literally like, five minutes before the ceremony, I'm emailing Zoom links to people. But that ended up being really great because her family was there and my family was there. It was most important for our parents to see it.\" The couple is planning to have a large reception with their family and friends when it is safer to do so. After all that has occurred in 2020, the couple says the silver lining is being able to celebrate their love. \"Ourselves and our friends have been taking everything very seriously, like a lot of people have, and we haven't seen many people at all and kept away from going in public too much. So to just get to have a day where you got to be with your friends, everybody just kept saying, 'Oh my gosh, to be making happy memories again feels so nice,'\" Feimster says. \"I think it ended up being even more special for us and for our friends, because 2020 has been so overshadowed by so much loss for so many people, and hardships and anxiety. It was just a nice, special, happy day, where for one day you didn't think about all the stuff that's been going on.\" The standup comedian adds, \"We're really thrilled and just so happy that we could do this. I do think it's an important thing for people to know that this is something that means a lot to us. We love each other and we wanted to be able to make this kind of commitment to each other like our friends have been able to make and our family. And to have so much support from people has meant a lot. We're just really happy that we got to do this.\" The newlyweds are jetting off to the Maldives in a couple of weeks for their honeymoon. \"This really great travel agency out of Chicago where Jax lived, it's called 6 Degrees, they planned this really great trip where we don't have to think about a thing,\" Feimster tells PEOPLE. \"They're just planning down from every second, so we're excited.\" While the comedian says they're looking forward to their vacation, Feimster admits it's \"still a little nerve-racking to be flying right now.\" \"But we'll have masks and there's a lot of tests going there, tests landing there,\" she says. \"We're doing it as safe as possible.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

RELATED:What to Know About the Biden Administration's Climate Summit Politicians like Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeau, German ChancellorAngela Merkeland New Zealand Prime MinisterJacinda Ardernwere among the virtual attendees, along with Russian PresidentVladimir Putin(despite tensions with Biden) and Brazilian PresidentJair Bolsonaro, and Chinese President Xi Jinping. \"No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand,\" Biden, 78, told his counterparts at the summit. \"All of us, all of us — and particularly those of us who represent the world's largest economies — we have to step up.\" Biden laid out a plan, he said, to be a net-zero emissions economy by 2050 — though he implored other countries to follow suit, noting the U.S. makes up only 15 percent of the world's emissions. (It's still the largest emitter worldwide.) Thunberg, who has been famously direct in her criticism of what she calls hesitancy to embrace the science and risks of climate change, told lawmakers in her testimony she was not holding her breath on such promises. \"I don't believe for a second that you will actually do this,\" she said. She laid out what she says major world powers like the U.S. need to do to start relieving the world of the dangerous effects of climate change. Those critical of her calls for reform say the changes would too seriously hurt the economy —to which she has respondedthat a changing climate is far more dangerous. \"We have to end fossil-fuel subsidies, stop new exploration and extraction, completely divest from fossil fuels and keep the carbon in the ground, now,\" Thunberg said on Thursday. \"Especially the U.S., taking into account the fact that it is the biggest emitter in history.\" As Thunberg's prominence rose in recent years, she found herself on the receiving end of mockery by former PresidentDonald Trump, who has played down climate change. Thunberg, for her part, responded to Trump's barbswith her own. RELATED:Meet Jerome Foster II, Teen Climate Hero and Greta Thunberg's Friend: Saving the Planet Is 'Up to Us' The teen gave Biden her endorsement last October, saying she typically avoids getting involved in politics but Trump's beliefs on climate change made \"the upcoming US elections is above and beyond all that.\" Since Biden was sworn in, Thunberg has amped up her pressure on the new administration.

Chris Murphy's 'Mission': The End of an American Epidemic of Gun Violence The Biden White House disagrees, noting the president has made climate change a priority — organizing this week's climate summit and creating a new \"climate envoy\" position in his Cabinet, to which he appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry. Nonetheless, taking her own advice, Thunberg pressed U.S. lawmakers on Thursday to take greater action on what she views as the world's gravest issue. \"Sooner or later, people are going to realize what you have been doing all this time — that's inevitable,\" she said. \"You still have time to do the right thing and to save your legacies, but that window of time is not going to last for long. What happens then?\" She continued: \"We, the young people, are the ones who are going to write about you in the history books. We are the ones who get to decide how you will be remembered.

Now, take a look back at the Wisconsin Republican’s days as a rising star in the party, when he was former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s running mate, in this 2012 PEOPLE story. Surfing in the aisle and assembling peanut-butter-and-honey sandwiches in the galley, three generations of the Romney and Ryan families were making fast friends when PEOPLE hopped on the campaign bus Aug. 12, the day after GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, 65, brought Rep. Paul Ryan, 42, aboard. The seven-term Wisconsin conservative, a pro-life Catholic, puts the ticket solidly on the right on both social and fiscal issues. He also comes with three young kids-playmates for the Romney grandchildren, who often tag along. During an exclusive chat, the two men-plus wives Ann Romney, 63, and Janna Ryan, 43-made discoveries about each other that even the VP vetting team hadn’t turned up. Governor, in the 24 hours since introducing your running mate, what have you learned about him? Mitt Romney: He’s got a great sense of humor-I guess with three young kids you have to. His grace in dealing with children is absolutely delightful. Mrs. Romney, what do you see in the chemistry between the men? Ann Romney: They’re able to communicate on this very intellectual policy-wonk level. MR: I like policy. I like solving tough problems. Same thing with Paul. But can he quoteO Brother, Where Art Thou? MR [to Paul Ryan]: Have you seen that movie? Paul Ryan: Yeah, of course! AR: It’s our favorite. We can quote the whole movie. MR: He’s probably seen it once and he can quote the lines. I’ve seen it multiple times, and it’s taken me a long time to get the quotes. [Laughter] Rep. Ryan, you’re the same age as the Romneys’ son Tagg. Do you see the governor as an equal? PR: I do see him as a partner. When he offered me to join the ticket, the two things he said to me were that we share the same values and that I can help him execute because of my experience. So what I see is I offer a complementary set of skills to help him govern. Mrs. Ryan, what does Gov. Romney need to know about your husband’s work style and habits? Janna Ryan: He’s pretty low-maintenance. Paul goes with the flow and has one of the sunniest demeanors and most positive outlooks of anyone I’ve ever met. I’d say Mitt’ll probably have a lot of fun with him. Congressman, given your family history [his father, grandfather and great-grandfather all died of heart attacks in their 50s], what’s your health regimen? PR: I do the P90X [DVD cardio] workout and [another program] called Insanity. And I try to eat well. Any food weaknesses? PR: I drink coffee in the morning. What’s on your workout playlist? PR: I grew up in the ’70s and ’80s, so I listen to classic rock: AC/DC; Zeppelin. What are you reading for fun? PR: I read policy. Fun? Fun is biographies. And I listen to lectures from the Great Courses in the car wherever I go. I’m listening to a great one on Voltaire right now. I enjoy studying the Enlightenment, which is 18th-century debate. Any low-brow pleasures, like The Real Housewives? PR: I don’t have time, but I like movies.The Good, The Bad and The Uglyis on my iPad. Who does the home finances? PR: It’s a joint effort. I do most of the bill paying. We buy a lot of used stuff. JR: I’m a consignment store shopper. I love a bargain. What was your last splurge? PR: I don’t know. We don’t buy a lot of things. I’m a big hunter, so splurging is: I got a new bow last year. Oh, I got a new chain saw. It was nice. It’s a Stihl. MR [with boyish envy]: You got a Stihl chain saw? The congressman also likes to “noodle,” which is wrestling catfish bare-handed, I hear. Have the two of you made a noodling date yet? MR: Uh, I’m not going to be doing a lot of noodling. I enjoy fly-fishing, but noodling, I’m afraid, I’ll leave to Paul. Rep. Ryan, a blog suggests “Dreamy” as your Secret Service code name. [Both women laugh] PR: We won’t pass that on. Are we allowed to say [the code name]? MR: No. JR: But it’s not Dreamy! Last one: First thing a Vice President Ryan would do on Jan. 20, 2013?

President Donald TrumpandFirst Lady Melania Trumpwere criticized online for shaking hands with the 92-year-old monarch rather than offering a bow and curtsy when theymet for the first time on Friday. However, the Trumps didn’t break royal protocol. “There are no obligatory codes of behavior when meeting The Queen or a member of the Royal Family,” according to theroyal family’s official website, “but many people wish to observe the traditional forms.” The explanation continues, “For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way.” While visiting Windsor Castle in April 2016, formerPresident Barack Obamaand formerFirst Lady Michelle Obamaalsogreeted the Queen with a handshake. Of course, there is still proper etiquette to follow. According to the royal family’s website, Queen Elizabeth should be addressed as “Your Majesty” upon presentation, and subsequently as “Ma’am.” Male members of royals should be greeted as “Your Royal Highness” and subsequently “Sir,” while women are to be first addressed as “Your Royal Highness” then subsequently as “Ma’am.” Royal rules are sometimes made to be broken. Although touching the Queen is generally frowned upon, Michelle Obama warmly wrapped her arm around the monarch during a 2009 reception at Buckingham Palace. Queen Elizabeth appeared to not mind the gesture, responding by putting her own arm around the first lady’s waist. Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating didn’t make out as well — he was dubbed the “Lizard of Oz” by tabloids after touching the Queen in 1992, according toTime. Another Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, was also criticized for laying hands on Queen Elizabeth to guide her through a crowd in 2000. Last month,Susan Sarandonignored the custom of being presented to Queen Elizabeth — the actress simply walked up and introduced herself at theRoyal Windsor Cup polo match. Sarandon was likely unaware of the tradition, but the Queen seemed to enjoy her company all the same. The monarch offered a big smile while her husband, Prince Philip, 97, appeared not to recognize Sarandon.U.K. outlet theDaily Expressreportedthat he leaned across his wife seemingly to get a better look at the face of their visitor.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

It was his last solo outing before he was supposed to go on a weekend anniversary trip with his wife, Denise. The hours passed, and Mike never returned. His father-in-law went looking for him and found his abandoned boat. His vehicle was still on the shore. But there was no sign of Mike.

His performance there earned him a scholarship to attend the University of San Francisco, where the 6-foot-9 Russell helped the team earn 56 straight victories and two NCAA titles in 1955 and 1956. Russell was selected by the St. Louis Hawks with the second overall pick in the 1956 NBA Draft but was traded to the Boston Celtics the same day. The partnership would prove a fruitful one — together with head coach Red Auerbach, the Celtics won 11 championships during Russell's tenure. Eight of those titles came consecutively from 1959 to 1966, a feat that has not been replicated again in the NBA or the other major American sports leagues.

And when Buckingham Palace opens its doors to visitors for theannual summer exhibitionin July, more than 250 objects from over 100 countries and territories will be on display. Among the gifts that will be shown during the opening of the State Rooms from July 22 to Oct. 1 will be a bag of salt, a model of a grand ship from China and a totem pole from Canada. The exhibit will also reveal how the gifts have helped mark significant moments in the Queen’s life. During hisvisit to the palace in October 2015, President Xi Jinping of China gave the monarch the Vessel of Friendship, a model of the “treasure ship” decorated with a dove and an olive branch medallion, which are symbols of friendship and peace. In 1956, the Queen received a magnificent beaded Yoruba throne given by the people of Nigeria. And in 1953, she was gifted a pair of baskets woven from coconut leaves by Queen Sālote Tupou III of Tonga during her seven-month Commonwealth Tour. She received a hand-beaten silver bowl of fruits from President Kenneth Kaunda on behalf of the government and people of Zambia in 1991. During her visit to Canada in 1971, the Queen was presented with a wooden mini totem pole carved by the Kwakiutl people of the Northwest coast. The pole is topped by the mythical thunderbird with outstretched wings. A much larger one — created from a single log of Western Red Cedar and standing at 100-feet tall — had been given to the Queen by the people of British Columbia to mark the centenary of the province in 1958. It currently stands in Windsor Great Park. At the humbler end of the scale, Salt Island, one of the British Virgin Islands, presented Her Majesty with a linen bag containing salt on her90th birthday in 2016. The gift represented the tradition of the island paying the monarch an annual rent of a pound of salt on their birthday. Also featured in the collection will be 100 items given to the Queen by the people and organizations of the United Kingdom. There is a gilded bronze owl, a small-scale replica of the owls designed by John Thorp for the plinths outside Leeds Civic Hall and a Buckingham Palace London Underground sign she was given while on a visit to Aldgate East Tube Station in 2010.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The Democratic politician, who lost the 2018 Florida governor’s race by less than half a percentage point to Ron DeSantis, made headlines this spring after he was found drunk in a hotel room with another man who may have overdosed on drugs and was treated by responders, according to local police. Authorities also said that a substance suspected to be meth was found in the room, though Gillum said he had only had alcohol. The other man identified himself as an escort through the website Rent Men, according to alocal TV news article. He told theMiami New Timesin March that he and Gillum had been “friends for a while.” Gillum, 41, addressed the speculation fueled by that encounter when he spoke with Hall in the season premiere of her talk show on Monday. \"The truth is, is that, Tamron, everyone believes the absolute worst about that day. At this stage, I don't have anything else to have to conceal. ... What was most hurtful was this belief that I was somehow living a lie in my marriage and in my family,\" he said. \"To be very honest with you, when you didn't ask the question, you put it out there, is whether or not I identify as gay. And the answer is, I don't identify as gay, but I do identify as bisexual,\" he continued. \"And that is something that I have never shared publicly before.\" Gillum spoke with Hall in the emotional interview alongside his wife, R. Jai Gillum. Hall, 49, told PEOPLE last week that it was “one of the most difficult interviews I’ve ever conducted” and their conversation was “intense and at moments it was heartbreaking, upsetting and it was disorienting.” \"I literally got broken down to my most bare place, to the place where I wasn't even sure that I wanted to live — not because of what I had done, but because of everything that was being said about me,\" Andrew told Hall. Photos from the scene also circulated in corners of the internet, including one of an unconscious Andrew \"on the floor ... literally lying in my own vomit,\" as he told Hall. Speculation about Andrew’s private life swept across social media after it was reported the former Tallahassee mayor was found in the hotel in Miami, where he said he had traveled to officiate a friend’s wedding. “All of those things are untrue,” Andrew told Hall on her show, referencing allegations that he was having an orgy or was using drugs. (He also said he cleared a drug test days later when entering rehab for alcoholism.) Authorities also told PEOPLE at the time that the incident was not being treated as a criminal matter and Andrew was not charged with any crime. He said Monday what helped him through the immediate aftermath was “the grace that I received from my wife.” “This was without us knowing whether or not there would be a future Andrew and R. Jai,” he told Hall. “At this point, this was her caring for me as a human.” RELATED:Tamron Hall Talks 'Heartbreaking' Interview with Former Fla. Political Star Found Drunk in Hotel Scandal Hall told PEOPLE that R. Jai was \"tough as nails\" and \"defiant\" during the interview, saying she didn't want the incident to define their marriage. R. Jai told Hall that she believes her husband was experiencing depression in the year since he lost the gubernatorial race and that he was struggling to find words to seek help. Instead, she said he resorted to an atypically “reckless” decision “because he needed to talk to somebody and probably didn’t have words.” Andrew said he “took to drinking at a level that I had never done before” after he lost the 2018 race and that he would sometimes drink heavily throughout the day, hiding whiskey in coffee cups. He was seen crying off set while R. Jai spoke with Hall, saying she “was adamantly opposed to talking” after the incident “because I feel like this day and age, anyone who is a public figure, people feel entitled to every single part of them and it can destroy you.” R. Jai said \"love and sexuality exist on a spectrum” and that all she cares about “is what’s between us and what agreement do we make to be in a relationship with each other.” “I don’t think it’s anyone’s business,” she said. “I don’t think it’s fair to people who are not heterosexual or not assumed heterosexual, they should ever have to say or disclose what they are because of how judgmental people are.” During the interview, Andrew addressed whether he envisions a political comeback in his future. He could run for office again “if I put my mind to that,” he said, though he said he was also open to the possibility he may never run again. “There is not a thing that has happened in my life — scandalous or not — to cause me to believe that if I have service to give an elected office as a means in order to render that I couldn’t do that,” he says. “Now, would it be hard? Absolutely. But Donald Trump is president.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

As she recounted in the caption, the day had been an emotional rollercoaster and marked the end of the transition before Trump took office. As Mrs. Obama noted, Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 election \"by a far closer margin than the one we've seen this year,\" when President-electJoe Bidendefeated Trump by at least 290-232 electoral votes and more than five million more votes nationwide,according to the Associated Press. \"I was hurt and disappointed—but the votes had been counted and Donald Trump had won. The American people had spoken. And one of the great responsibilities of the presidency is to listen when they do,\" Mrs. Obama wrote. \"So my husband and I instructed our staffs to do what George and Laura Bush had done for us: run a respectful, seamless transition of power—one of the hallmarks of American democracy.\" As she describes on Instagram, the Obama administration \"invited the folks from the president-elect’s team\" into the White House, \"and prepared detailed memos for them, offering what we’d learned over the past eight years.\" RELATED:Officials Nationwide Say There's No Evidence of Voter Fraud, Despite Trump's Claims The transition wasn't easy, though, with Mrs. Obama noting how, prior to his election, Trump had spreadracist conspiracy theoriesabout her husband. \"I have to be honest and say that none of this was easy for me,\" she wrote. \"Donald Trump had spread racist lies about my husband that had put my family in danger. That wasn’t something I was ready to forgive. But I knew that, for the sake of our country, I had to find the strength and maturity to put my anger aside.\" After her husband's win, Mrs. Obama invited Melania Trump into the White House, to discuss the transition and offer advice about what life would soon be like. \"I knew in my heart it was the right thing to do—because our democracy is so much bigger than anybody’s ego,\" she wrote. \"Our love of country requires us to respect the results of an election even when we don’t like them or wish it had gone differently—the presidency doesn’t belong to any one individual or any one party.\" Four years later, though, Trump has refused to concede the election, impeding attempts for the Biden-Harris Administration to smoothly transition into office. Unlike Obama's transition to Trump, this one is made even more complicated due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Public health officials have expressed concern that Trump's refusal to publicly accept his loss could throw a wrench in efforts to contain the virus. Instead, Trump has spent more than a week arguing that the election was somehow \"stolen\" from him.

With Trump — who has worked to undermine American confidence in a number of institutions, from the FBI to the free press — now setting his sights on sowing distrust in the bedrock of American democracy (a free and fair electoral system), the worry is that the damage could belong-lasting. Though she didn't call him out by name, Mrs. Obama echoed those concerns on Monday, urging \"all Americans, especially our nation's leaders,\" not to \"play along\" with claims of election fraud. \"To ... play along with these groundless conspiracy theories—whether for personal or political gain—is to put our country’s health and security in danger.

The 44th president, 61, has once again shared his end-of-the-year list of his favorite films, books, and songs, featuring everything from rising indie stars, to blockbuster flicks, to his wifeMichelle's latest memoir. In three separate posts, Obama promised he organized lists of \"great movies,\" \"great songs\" and \"books I enjoyed,\" and he didn't disappoint. When it comes to music, Obama featured some major tracks, includingKendrick Lamar's Grammy-nominated \"The Heart Part 5,\"Beyoncé's mega-hit \"Break My Soul,\" SZA's fan-favorite \"Shirt,\" \"About Damn Time\" from Lizzo andBad Bunny's \"Tití Me Preguntó.\" But of course, he made sure to toss in some curveballs. Now, the world knows Obama listened toSteve Lacy'sGemini Rights, the latest single from Nx Worries featuring H.E.R. and evennewcomer Omar Apollo— who reacted as anyone would on Twitter,blasting the timeline with heart-smile emojis. While Maggie Rogers, Ari Lennox and more also reacted to the news under his Instagram post of the list with gratitude, perhaps the most shocked of the bunch was singer-songwriter Ethel Cain — whose song \"American Teenager\" was selected by Obama to join the list. \"Did not have a former president including my anti-war, anti-patriotism fake pop song on his year end list on my 2022 bingo,\" shejoked on Twitter. On his movie list, Obama included big titles such asThe Fabelmans, Everything Everywhere All At OnceandTop Gun: Maverick— while also opting for a few more under-the-radar choices. Additional films selected by Obama includePetite Man, Decision to Leave, Aftersun, Descendant, Happening, A Heroand more. AsAubrey Plazaexcitedly reacted to, the former president even toasted her 2022 flickEmily the Criminal, directed by John Patton Ford. \"No words 🤯🤯🤯,\" Plaza wrote, sharing a screenshot ofObama's list on Instagram.

Of course, he couldn't forget what very likely is his favorite of the bunch —The Light We Carryby...Michelle Obama! \"A huge thank you to each and every one of you who's taken the time to readThe Light We Carry,\" the former first ladywrote on Twitterearlier in the week. \"I've read so many of your thoughtful reflections and smiled at your photos with family and friends during my book tour.

On Monday, attorneys for both Hobbs and Maricopa County filed suit against Lake, seeking more than $25,000 in attorney's fees after the Republican attempted to reverse the results of her loss in a two-day trial. An Arizona judge denied Lake's bid on Saturday, saying in a filing thathe did not\"find clear and convincing evidence\" that misconduct affected the result of the 2022 general election. On Monday, attorneys for Hobbs (who currently serves as Arizona secretary of state, but will be sworn in as governor in January) and Maricopa Countyclaimed Lakehad taken a \"throw everything at the wall and see what sticks\" approach to trying to overturn the election in her favor. They now seek $25,050 in attorney's fees incurred during the trial, writing in their court filing: \"Courts are established by Arizona's Constitution and statutes to resolve actual disputes between parties. They do not exist so that candidates for political office can attempt to make political statements and fundraise.\" The filing continues: \"And they should not be used to harass political opponents and sow completely unfounded doubts about the integrity of elections. All of those things happened in this matter. Enough really is enough. It is past time to end unfounded attacks on elections and unwarranted accusations against elections officials.\" Even before she lost the race, Lake had falsely claimed that there's \"a lot of corruption\" in the electoral system, and had publicly voiced support for Trump's claims that his 2020 election was rigged against him, despite a lack of evidence to support that. Sec. Hobbs previously drew scorn from Trump supporters for defending the state's 2020 elections against those unfounded allegations of widespread fraud (a role that led her to be on thereceiving end of death threats). Her role in preserving the integrity of that election introduced her to the national stage, and ultimately led to the gubernatorial bid.

Lake's latest losing lawsuit came after another suit she filed back in April, in which she sought to block both Maricopa and Pima counties from using electronic election equipment.

Kennedy’shistoric Wexford ranch in Middleburg, Virginia has sold for $2.85 million. The home hit the market in Septmeber 2016 for $5.95 million, according to real estate agencyThomas & Talbot. The classic estate, which was built in the early 1960s and designed by Jackie herself, sits on over 166 acres overlooking the Blue Ridge Mountains. The home has retained all the nostalgic charm it had when the family resided there, a testament to the first lady’s timeless style. The estate’s architect, Keith Williams, drew up the plans for the 4-bedroom, 4-bath house based largely on rough sketches created by Jackie and pages she tore out of magazines likeBetter Homes and Gardens,according toArchitectural Digest. The estate also served as a vacation spot for another first family. One of Wexford’s previous owners invited the Reagans to stay on the property while he campaigned for president. According toThomas & Talbot, Jackie Kennedy loved the estate for both the privacy the town offered her and the opportunity to ride horses with her children, fox hunt and spend time with nearby families that had the same appreciation for the equestrian lifestyle. Located about an hour away from the White House, the estate would be a perfect weekend getaway for a new Washington, D.C.–based buyer. A pool, tennis court, stable, stone walls and a private entry are also featured on the bucolic property. According toForbes, the Kennedys only visited the estate a few times as a family. The last was shortly before JFK’s assassination. The property was reportedly sold months after, with the caveat that no publicity photos of the house be released for 10 years.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

While she enjoyed her \"sweet little miracle,\" the paralympic gold medalist told PEOPLE about the long and trying journey she endured to deliver her baby. The odds of becoming pregnantweren't in the couple's favor: Snyder was diagnosed with male factor infertility that resulted from a childhood medical condition, and their best option was in vitro fertilization. Speaking to PEOPLE, Weggemann recalled her husband's reasons for opening up about his infertility. \"Jay was adamant that we have the conversation around male infertility,\" Weggemann said. \"Society needed to see a couple who said, 'Actually, it's the non-disabled spouse that has the fertility struggles.' \" After several surgical procedures, hundreds of injections and one unsuccessful transfer, they announced that their second egg transfer had worked, and they weregoing to be parents. However, Weggemann facedanother major hurdlewhen it came time to welcome their little bundle of joy.

Though the epidural didn't actually work (likely due to scarring from her paralysis) and she delivered the baby via cesarean section, Weggemann succeeded in overcoming her fear. \"I took some of my power back by not letting that day in 2008 define everything, and by being able to face it again so I could bring a baby into this world,\" she told PEOPLE.

DeMille Award Sunday night, taking sharp aim at Trump without ever uttering his name. “There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hook in my heart not because it was good.  It was ‑‑ there was nothing good about it, but it was effective, and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter, someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back,” Streep said, referencing Trump’s mocking of disabledNew York Timesreporter Serge F. Kovaleski. “Disrespect invites disrespect. Violence incites violence. When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose,” she also said before calling for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to protect journalists. “This brings me to the press. We need the principal press to hold power to account to call them on the carpet for every outrage.” RELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Assault “That’s why our founders enshrined the press and its freedom in our Constitution.

Not long after, Trump took to Twitter to slam what he has repeatedly called the “dishonest media” for not reporting on his promised Mexican border wall in a way that satisfies him. “Dishonest media says Mexico won’t be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly. Media is fake!” he tweeted around the same time the Globes wrapped up. Dishonest media says Mexico won't be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: A TV host and sports broadcaster has accused Sen. Al Franken of kissing and groping her without her consent in 2006. Leeann Tweeden took to Twitter on Thursday to accuse the Minnesota Democrat and formerSaturday Night Livestar oftouching her breasts as she was sleepingwhile the two were on a USO Tour to entertain troops in December 2006. “I’ve decided it’s time to tell my story,” she tweeted, including a photo of the alleged incident. “It wasn’t until I was back in the U.S. and looking through the CD of photos we were given by the photographer that I saw this one,” she wrote in a piece for KABC. “I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated. How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?” Tweeden says Franken also kissed her against her will during a rehearsal for a skit the then-comedian had written for the tour. Franken quickly apologized for the incident in a statement obtained by PEOPLE, saying: “I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t. I shouldn’t have done it.” I’ve decided it’s time to tell my story.#MeToohttps://t.co/TqTgfvzkZg — Leeann Tweeden (@LeeannTweeden)November 16, 2017 Franken later issued a longer statement, also obtained by PEOPLE, in which he apologized again and said “there’s no excuse” for his actions in the photo. “I don’t know what was in my head when I took took that picture, and it doesn’t matter,” he said. “There’s no excuse. I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself. It isn’t funny. It’s completely inappropriate. It’s obvious how Leeann would feel violated by that picture.” NEW@AlFrankenstatement on allegations that he kissed and groped a woman without her consent. “The first thing I want to do is apologize.”pic.twitter.com/81hc2IYYIL — Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur)November 16, 2017 Franken also referenced the recent wave of sexual misconduct allegations that have been leveled against men of power in various industries, and said that it has forced men to think about the impact their actions have on women. “Over the past few months, all of us — including and especially men who respect women — have been forced to take a good, hard look at our own actions and think (perhaps, shamefully, for the first time) about how those actions have affected women,” Franken said. Tweeden later gave a press conference in which she said she accepted Franken’s apology and was not calling for him to step down. But she noted that he did not apologize to her when she ran into him previously after the incident. “The apology, sure, I accept it,” she said. “People make mistakes and of course he knew he made a mistake.” Tweeden added of Franken’s actions, “Nothing like that is ever funny. I was just disgusted. I felt violated, he betrayed my trust and obviously that is not what I wanted.” Earlier on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responded to Tweeden’s allegations with a call for anEthics Committee investigation of Franken’s actions. “As with all credible allegations of sexual harassment or assault, I believe the Ethics Committee should review the matter. I hope the Democratic Leader will join me on this,” McConnell said, according to Politico. “Regardless of party, harassment and assault are completely unacceptable-in the workplace or anywhere else.” Tweeden also wrote in her piece that Franken, the headliner on the USO tour, told her he had written a skit for her to star in with him, and she “agreed to play along.” “When I saw the script, Franken had written a moment when his character comes at me for a ‘kiss’. I suspected what he was after, but I figured I could turn my head at the last minute, or put my hand over his mouth, to get more laughs from the crowd,” she wrote. “On the day of the show Franken and I were alone backstage going over our lines one last time. He said to me, ‘We need to rehearse the kiss.’ I laughed and ignored him. Then he said it again. I said something like, ‘Relax Al, this isn’tSNL… we don’t need to rehearse the kiss.’” Tweeden wrote that she became “uncomfortable” after Franken continued to press the issue. “He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said ‘OK’ so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth,” she wrote. “I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn’t be so nice about it the next time.” Tweeden said she felt “disgusted and violated” after the incident but that she didn’t tell anyone at the time. It wasn’t until later that she saw the photo of Franken apparently groping her after she fell asleep on the plane ride back to the U.S. “I wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster,” she wrote. “But that was then, this is now. I’m no longer afraid.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Mitt Romney and Mike Lee both went into voluntary quarantine after the news broke that Paul had tested positive for the virus, which has infected more than 43,000 Americans as of Tuesday morning and killed 539,according to aNew York Timestracker. “I felt that it was highly unlikely that I was positive since I have had no symptoms of the illness, nor have I had contact with anyone who has either tested positive for the virus or been sick,” Paul said in a further statement on Monday. “For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine, realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee, I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol,” he continued. “The current guidelines would not have called for me to get tested nor quarantined. It was my extra precaution, out of concern for my damaged lung, that led me to get tested.” RELATED:Senator Rand Paul, Who Delayed Then Voted Against Pandemic Aid, Tests Positive for Coronavirus “(Paul) is feeling fine and is in quarantine,” his officetweetedSunday. “He is asymptomatic and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.” Paul joinsReps. Ben McAdams and Mario Diaz-Balart, who also tested positive for the virus which has infected various political figures among hundreds of thousands of others worldwide. Paul said he wasn’t experiencing any symptoms and took the test in mid-March out of an abundance of caution for having previously injured his lung during an assault by a neighbor in 2017 over a landscaping issue.

And sad to say, so much has changed in Washington that the Capitol Police do have to stay at high alert all the time because of the attack on January 6th,\" he said. \"And as the hearings prove more clearly every day, the blame for that actual insurrection all goes to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's puppet.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell appeared on CNN’sState of the Unionon Sunday and called Putin a “thug.” Although he said he did not think Russia and the U.S. conducted themselves in similar ways, he did not comment specifically on Trump’s remarks. “I’m not going to critique the president’s every utterance,” McConnell said. “But I do think America is exceptional, America is different. We don’t operate in any way the way the Russians do. I think there’s a clear distinction here that all Americans understand, and I would not have characterized it that way.” Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a steadfast Trump critic, shared similar sentiments on ABC’sThis Week. “Putin is an enemy of political dissent. The U.S. celebrates political dissent and the right for people to argue free from violence about places or ideas that are in conflict,” Sasse said. “There is no moral equivalency between the United States of America, the greatest freedom living nation in the history of the world, and the murderous thugs that are in Putin’s defense of his cronyism.” Vice PresidentMike Penceappeared on NBC’sMeet the Pressand said he did not see Trump’s comments as him creating a moral equivalency between the two countries. “President Trump has been willing to be critical of our country’s actions in the past,” he said. “But what you’re hearing there is a determination by the president of the United States to not let semantics or the arguments of the past get in the way of exploring the ability to work together with Russia and with President Putin in the days ahead.” O’Reilly’s full interview with Trump will air at 4 p.m. ET during a pre-Super Bowl special on Fox.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

After news of Mary’s memoir,Too Much and Never Enough, was first leaked in June, the president’s younger brother, Robert Trump,sued Mary and publisher Simon & Schusterseeking to block the book, citing a confidentiality agreement Mary signed in 2001 in connection with a decades-old fight over family patriarch Fred Trump Sr.'s estate. Although a judge recently agreed to lift the temporary restraining order against Simon & Schuster, the order remains imposed on Mary, pending a July 10 hearing. The book is set to be released on July 28. In an affidavit submitted on Thursday night and obtained by PEOPLE on Friday, Mary wrote that she “never believed” the confidentiality agreement she signed “could possibly restrict me from telling the story of my life.” \"I never believed that the Settlement Agreement resolving discrete financial disputes could possibly restrict me from telling the story of my life or publishing a book discussing anything contained in the Book, including the conduct and character of my uncle, the sitting President of the United States, during his campaign for re-election,” she wrote. “Moreover, my uncle, the President, has spoken out about our family and the will dispute on numerous occasions.\" Robert Trump's lawyer, Charles Harder, did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment. Mary and her lawyers have also claimed that the agreement should not hold up as it was based on fraudulent information. \"The New York Times's detailed analysis and investigation revealed for the first time that the valuations on which I had relied in entering into the Settlement Agreement, and which were used to determine my compensation under the Agreement, were fraudulent,\" Mary said in the affidavit. \"I relied on the false valuations provided to me by my uncles and aunt, and would never have entered into the Agreement had I known the true value of the assets involved.\" Her lawyer, Theodore Boutrous, alsotoldCNN’s Chris Cuomo on Thursday: \"The settlement agreement that includes the nondisclosure agreement was the product of fraud, therefore it's void, it can't be enforced. It's one of the many reasons it's just not worth the paper it's printed on at this point.\" RELATED:Trump Niece's Tell-All Temporarily Blocked by a Judge Ahead of July Hearing as She Vows Appeal A description of the July 28 book shared by the publisher describes Mary's book as a \"revelatory, authoritative portrait of Donald J.

Scheinkman's decision also noted that due to the office President Trump currently holds, his family may not be entitled to the same amount of privacy they once were, when he was just a successful real estate developer -- although he made it clear that he was not suggesting any final decision. A spokesman for Simon & Schuster previously said in a statement that Mary's book is \"a work of great interest and importance to the national discourse that fully deserves to be published for the benefit of the American public.\" \"As all know, there are well-established precedents against prior restraint and pre-publication injunctions, and we remain confident that the preliminary injunction will be denied,\" the spokesman said.

Second, notice that Rowling isn’t simply retweeting or replying to her bashers like she normally does. The reader comments were attached to her tweets as cropped photos. This allowed Rowling to grey-out their Twitter handles so the users couldn’t be easily identified. Perhaps she doesn’t want to promote those who are attacking her, but I suspect there’s another reason: She’s sparing them the avalanche of blowback from her supporters.

What did Kimmel, 50, glean from this year that he calls a “tsunami”? “I learned there are people whose voices are not heard, and I hope that other people grab this baton and run with it, because it’s not enough to watch Rachel Maddow and nod along at home,” he says. “I learned that I can’t keep it together on television. I learned that it really makes an impression when someone most of the country believes is a moron speaks intelligently for a change. It’s like watching a chimpanzee do math. It’s going to be a viral video, simple as that.” And for our part, we didn’t know how much we needed to hear from Jimmy Kimmel — yes, the former co-host ofThe Man Show— until Jimmy Kimmel needed to talk to us, about so much more. “Maybe there’s a little bit more to me than railing against pumpkin spice lattes,” he says. “Make no mistake, I’m still anti–pumpkin spice latte. I don’t want to diminish silly things. Not everything is a mountain. The molehills need to be taken care of too.” In 2017, Kimmel — one of EW’s Entertainers of the Year — scaled them all. ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY:What’s the first thing that pops in your head when you try to wrap your head around the year you just had?JIMMY KIMMEL:One word? It’s like a tsunami, actually. On one hand, you have friends pass away and you have a baby, but then the baby goes through this rollercoaster and you go through it with the baby. It’s definitely been the most stressful year of my life — and then we have Donald Trump adding to the overall level of nervousness. [Laughs.] So, it hasn’t been a great year, to be honest with you. In terms of the work you put out there, though — the Oscars, the monologues — do you feel that it was one of the more rewarding years for you, professionally speaking?Isn’t it funny that you mentioned the Oscars? I keep forgetting that I hosted the Oscars this year. So many things have happened, so many moments that I’ll never forget.Thatcontinually slips my mind. I’m hoping I don’t forget to show up for the next Oscars. [Laughs.] That’d be nice.It should have been a great year, I guess. The Oscars went well and with the baby and everything, it’s definitely been an interesting year. That’s probably the best way I can characterize it. You’ve always enjoyed taking stands on silly issues likehating eCards, but this was also the year you came out swinging on some substantial issues, such as healthcare and gun control. During these monologues, you mentioned how you didn’t want to be doing this and that you’d rather be doing a comedy show. But it turned out to suit you very well. How apprehensive were you about wading into these complex, charged areas? And was it just a matter of feeling like common sense outweighed comedy at those times?Well, the first thing you need to know about me is I don’t really think before I speak, so I don’t think I knew what I was getting into. Even just talking about a family health situation, I did not realize that I would be asked about that family health situation 10 times a day for the next… who knows, maybe the rest of my life. Thank god things are going well, but if they weren’t, it would be very, very difficult. Actually, I was surprised there wasanyonethat was mad at me when I talked about health care. To me, it’s such a no-brainer that I knew there’d be CEOs in towers somewhere glaring disapprovingly, but the idea that regular people would get upset with me — that did not occur to me. And that was dwarfed by the number of people who were angry about my position on automatic weapons, which is also mind-boggling to me… I didn’t know that people would be sending letters to my house, wishing death upon my family. I would have hoped that they understand that whether they agree with me or not, it’s coming from a good place. I’m not making any money off of this, or at least I’m not making money opposing gun control. I’m not making money supporting healthcare. They’re just things that I think are important, and that doesn’t seem to be factored in as far as a lot of people go. But most of those people can’t spell the wordyou’re—they don’t know the difference between theeand the apostrophe — so I do take some comfort in that. If you’re looking for a common denominator, the people who are angry at me on gun control and healthcare don’t know how to spell the wordyou’re. Isn’t it at least rewarding to hear from all of these people who thanked you for shining a light on these issues?Yeah, it is. I mean, it just seems like simple common sense, but what it did do is, it gave me resolve. We went to church and a guy came up to me, and he said he’s a veteran and he thanked me so much for helping with the Affordable Care Act, because he said it’s kept him alive. So many people say things like that, that I have to believe that there are good things happening as a result of Obamacare, and it is scary to imagine what might happen if that treatment and those drugs aren’t available to them. Especially people with children who write me, whether it be on social media or write letter or people I just run into, and they tell me how important it is. I wish everyone could hear these stories and really be open and listen to them, because it isn’t a red-versus-blue thing. I think anytime you see an opinion poll on something like this, the vast majority of Americans like this idea. We’ve been poisoned in whatever way to believe that one way is the right way and the other way is the wrong way. You knew that you’d probably alienate parts of your fan base that were skewing more right-wing. How did you seek to fine-tune the message so that it wouldn’t just be dismissed as partisan rhetoric?Well, I think it started that way. When I spoke about healthcare, it was accepted by the left and right, and that’s what scared the right wing. That’s when they decided to go on the attack and create these stories about me taking talking points from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer — which is nonsense — and being some kind of mouthpiece for the Democratic party, which I am not. My goal, when I spoke, was to convince the people who don’t agree with me and I think that that happened to a certain extent, and that’s what scared some of these Republican politicians and media outlets. And to this day they’re digging through my whole life, desperately trying to come up with something to discredit me. Don’t screw up, Jimmy.Luckily, all of my misbehavior has taken place on television. Even if you lost some of those viewers, you’ve seen a ratings bump this year, too. What does your gut tell you about what actually happened?Well, I don’t know. I had a certain fan base fromThe Man Showand Fox football that may have been surprised in a negative way by position as a… I think “leftard” is what they— That’s the technical term, yes.But this has always been me. I just didn’t feel like I needed to speak seriously about this thing in the past. I have, from time to time, spoken about serious things, but they weren’t necessarily controversial, and I think that’s the difference. And also the country is very different over the last 18 months, so I think that makes a big difference, too. I think people are just fighting all the time and it’s getting worse and worse and worse. You get branded one thing or the other, and if you’re branded one thing, the other side discounts everything you say, and that’s a terrible way to go about being a country. What did you hear from ABC as you were doing these monologues? Was it a relatively hands-off situation?We don’t really discuss content as far as the show goes. We’ve been on so long and the show is daily, and it moves so quickly that they pretty much leave me to my own devices. I also think they know I’m pretty set in my ways and even if they did want me to tone it down, telling me to tone it down would probably have the opposite effect. They also wanted me to shave my beard. You’re holding hard on that, right?I’m going to stick to this for a while. The big turning point came earlier this year with your newborn son, Billy, having this massive health scare. [He had a second successful heart surgery earlier this month.] How challenging was it to take something so personal to you onto national television? What tipped the scales for you to talk?Well, it really hit me in the elevator at Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, seeing these low-income families with very sick children being wheeled around the hospital, and I was just looking at them and wondering how they’re able to continue to work. Do they have jobs that their employer is good enough to give them paid time off? It seemed unlikely to me. I just was thinking about how hard it was for us as a family with health insurance and a great support system and we all have jobs and we all have great and understanding employers who support us in times like this, and I was just looking at these people and wondering what their situation was, and then finding out that Children’s Hospital will take care of these kids regardless of whether their parents can pay for it or not. It just seems very unfair to put that burden exclusively on private donors. I spoke to the people who run Children’s Hospital, and they were very fearful that the Affordable Care Act would go by the wayside because they felt that it would really hurt the hospital and how many patients they’re able to treat. I also felt like I had to say something because I’d been talking about the fact that my wife was pregnant for six months on the air and you can’t just come back and not say anything — at least I can’t. It’s not my way, and I just wouldn’t have been able to keep it bottled up, so I just decided to tell my story and to try to make something good come out of something that was very difficult, which is what I always try to do. But usually they are much simpler situations and mere annoyances, not life-changing emergencies. Let’s talk about another difficult monologue, about the Las Vegas massacre. That one obviously hit home for you and you didn’t want to let this attack simply be dismissed with “thoughts and prayers.” What was the trickiest part of crafting what you were going to say, knowing how divisive an issue gun control can be?Well, for me the hardest thing is keeping my anger in check because when somebody is born with holes in their heart, like my son was, you know, that’s nature. There’s nothing you can do about it. If it’s something that we can act on, we should at least be trying to fix this. And just imagining all of those children losing their parents and parents losing their children, and knowing that there’s no reason for it at all. Something can be done about it, we just choose not to. And also that this has happened over and over and over again, and every time it does, we get upset and then we come to grips with it and then we forget about it. Now, not all of us, of course; there’s some organizations doing great things out there, but that’s just how human beings work, and I just felt like I had to say something. Obviously these are opinions I’ve had for a long time, but when something happens in your hometown, it hits harder. NEXT PAGE: Kimmel on the upcoming Oscars and sparring with Roy Moore Looking back at all of these monologues this year, what do you think struck such a strong chord with people? How much of it do you attribute to the fact that you — as someone who never really seemed interested in politicizing his show — were just speaking from the heart? You were angry. You were sad. You were scared. You were shaken. You showed vulnerability.I guess it’s just the image the people have of me and going under whatever predisposition they had… When you surprise people, for good or bad, it makes more of an impact, and I just think people had a certain idea of me for the most part. Maybe there’s a little bit more to me than railing against pumpkin spice lattes in October. Still, an issue that should not be forgotten.Make no mistake, I’m still anti-pumpkin spice latte. I don’t want to diminish silly things. Not everything is a mountain. The molehills need to be taken care of, too. After Roy Mooreinvited you down to Alabamato mock Christian values “man to man,” you challenged the senatorial candidate to a fight….I’m pretty sure he challenged me to a fight. Right? What does “man to man” mean to you? I don’t think we were going dancing.I nearly accepted his inferred challenge to fightand then he disappeared…. I would have loved to have been in on those meetings where whichever idiot thought it was a good idea to engage me in a back and forth on Twitter. Who knows what happened, but there’s no amount of money I wouldn’t pay to have been sitting in, watching those meetings. Are people now looking to you to champion their social causes?Yes. Everyone is. Of course they don’t understand how it works, but there are people who think I should do a different issue every single night. They don’t realize that it won’t have an impact and then in fact, it will take away from the things I’ve already spoken about. But I do get a lot of that, especially from people I know asking me to make their cause my cause, and I really feel like I have to stay focused. I was planning to stay focused until ll of those people got shot in Las Vegas. I was planning to focus primarily on children’s health issues, but every once in a while, there’s a shark sighting, and you have to get out of the ocean. Let’s revisit the Oscars, which did in fact happen in 2017 — and they had the craziest ending ever. What was your goal going into the ceremony?My goal was to kill. That was my goal. I wanted to kill from the beginning of the show until the end of the show. I just didn’t expect that the end of the show would be so interesting. I wanted to keep the show lively and I wanted to make sure that there were elements of danger, like bringing a tour bus full of strangers who had no idea they were about to be on television, into the theater, and I wanted to keep people interested. I didn’t want to just do the monologue and then check out for the rest of the show. And everyone forgoteverythingas soon as that envelope was opened. [Laughs.] What was the cocktail of emotions you were feeling as that was unfolding?Well, at first, confusion. And then I had to remind myself that I wasn’t at home watching the Oscars — that I was the host of the Oscars and I was the only person who had a microphone on. I was sitting in the audience next to Matt Damon. I was just about to wrap the show up and this stuff is happening, and we can’t really hear what’s going on. In fact, nobody knows what’s going on. And I’m watching it as a spectator, and then I realized I’d better get up there because there’s nobody else who’s going to kind of take control. So I walked up on stage and people seemed shocked and mad, and my first reaction almost always is to start laughing. It just struck me as a funny situation. People were hashing things out, and we were on live television and Warren Beatty seemed to be the center of it, and I was tickled. [Laughs.] And then I realized that people were very upset, and then I realized also that “Oh, this is maybe the worst moment of somebody’s life here,” and maybe this shouldn’t be funny. Maybe I need to do something to just kill time until we figure out what happened.” I have to say, I’m never more comfortable than when chaos is happening around me, and I felt pretty comfortable in that moment — comfortable enough to just kind ofspeak. I don’t really even remember what I said. I’ve not watched it back, but I think I took the blame for it, just to end things. And we all know what happened from there. When in doubt, “Warren, what did you do?” is a great go-to line.That’s right! I said, “Warren, what did you just do?” [Laughs.] Well, I did a rehearsal and Warren, he wears glasses usually, so I thought maybe he had trouble reading the card. But now looking back, that makes no sense at all because not being able to read the card doesn’t equate to saying“La La Land.” I don’t know, it seemed funny to blame it on Warren, this icon. [Laughs.] Yeah, that was crazy. Pretend you could go into a time machine that would take you back to that moment. You’re sitting with Matt. You have two choices. The show can end right there, and everyone says, “You did a great job, Jimmy,” or the envelope mistake can happen again.Well, for the good of those producers, I probably would say, “Let’s just do it the right way and have the winners win and not have any nonsense, and have people be focused on the fact that the Oscars went well afterwards.” But it is great for this upcoming Oscars, because for some reason it adds to the interest in the show. I mean, obviously there’s not going to be another envelope mix-up — although now that I think about it, when Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield’s ear off, nobody expected that he was going to do it again a minute later. I’m glad you brought up this coming Oscars, whichyou’re hosting again. I know it’s a little early to talk about what you’ll be doing, but how do you top staggering human error?Well, with more human error. [Laughs.] I mean, Ihopethat we don’t top that. I don’t want to have the firstandsecond biggest blunders in the history of television on my watch. This article originally appeared onEntertainment Weekly.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision of 1973 that granted women the right to an abortion in every state, was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday. The 6-to-3 ruling reverses nearly 50 years of legal precedent and will completely change the landscape of women's reproductive rights by giving individual states the power to decide whether to allow the procedure. It is estimated that nearly half the country will enact near-total bans in the coming months.

Short confirmed the news on CNN'sOutFront, telling host Erin Burnett: \"I can confirm that I did receive a subpoena for the federal grand jury, and I complied to that subpoena. But under advice of counsel, I really can't say much more than that.\" As a House committee continues to look into the events of that day, a federal grand jury is also hearing testimony related to the riots and to efforts byDonald Trumpand his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election. CNN reports thatShort testified before the House committeeback in January, while his testimony to the grand jury came just last week.

Tensions between Pence and Trump spilled over into public view shortly before the rioters breached the Capitol that day, with Trump pushing Pence to overturn the results of the November election in his favor, after numerous legal attempts to contest the results failed in courts across the country. In a rally held near the White House on Jan. 6, Trump grew increasingly vocal in his demands while speaking to his supporters. \"Mike Pence, I hope you get to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country, and if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you,\" Trump said. RELATED:Mike Pence's Secret Service Detail Was 'Making Calls to Say Goodbye' as Mob Approached: Official Instead, Pence releaseda lengthy statementbreaking with the president, just moments ahead of a joint session of Congress to ratify the electoral vote. \"It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not,\" the statement read. As Pence's statement was released, the vice president and congressional lawmakers began to gather in the House of Representatives chamber to begin the counting of Electoral College votes. Roughly an hour into the process, Trump's supporters outside had overpowered police and forced their way into the building in a scene that eventually led to the deaths of four people as well as the evacuation of Congress and the vice president himself, who was whisked to an undisclosed location.

Trump, meanwhile, took to Twitter to single out Pence, writing that he \"didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\" Footage of the rioters would later show some of Trump's supporters shouting \"Hang Mike Pence\" —a cry that Trump allegedly endorsed, according to those who have testified under oath about the events of that day. Trump himself told ABC News' Jonathan Karl that the chants about hanging Pence were \"common sense\" because \"the people were very angry.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

In a preview piece the author published inThe Hollywood Reporteron Thursday, Wolff wrote that “at Mar-a-Lago, just before the new year, a heavily made-up Trump failed to recognize a succession of old friends.” On Friday, Wolff said White House officials say the president repeats himself with alarming frequency. “They’ve all tracked this,” Wolff told Guthrie. “In the beginning it was like every 25 or 30 minutes you would get the same three stories repeated. Now it’s the same three stories in every 10 minutes.” When Guthrie pressed Wolff to say what that suggests, Wolff replied: “I will quote Steve Bannon: He’s lost it.” The White House dismissed concerns about Trump’s cognitive functioning on Thursday, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders calling any comments “disgraceful” and “laughable” during a press briefing. “If he was unfit, he probably wouldn’t be sitting there,” Sanders said. “This is an incredibly strong and good leader.” However, Wolff said onTodayFriday that in private, “100 percent of the people around him” express concerns about the president’s ability to lead.

(Bannon also received a cease and desist letter, for comments that included calling Donald Trump Jr.’s Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer “treasonous.”) “The one description that everyone gave, that they all have in common, is that he is like a child. He has a need for immediate gratification,” he said. “It’s all about him,” Wolff added. “He just has to be satisfied in the moment.” The author also said Friday that he “absolutely spoke to the president.

There she has focused on workforce and family issues; and she and her husband,Jared Kushner, also a senior aide, have remained by the president’s side even amid historic turnover in the West Wing. Both Ivanka and Kushner have faced criticism given their lack of policy and political expertise.

While it’s clear the coronavirus is not directly related to one’s bowels, it seems the hysteria is stemming from the idea of having to be confined to one’s home and not being able to stock up on supplies readily. “Bulk buying toilet paper eliminates the small risk of running out if quarantined. People might not be able to eliminate the risk of catching coronavirus but they can eliminate the risk of running out of toilet paper, which makes most people feel they have control in this very uncertain situation,” Dr. Jay Zagorsky toldThe Boston Globe. Since the outbreak, social media users all over the world have shared several tweets and videos of people panic-buying toilet paper and other household supplies. .@SecAzar: \"Toilet paper is not an effective defense against getting the Coronavirus.\"pic.twitter.com/xObstc9W5v — ALX 🇺🇸 (@alx)March 13, 2020 “I’m not panicked about the virus itself, I’m panicked at the mass panic.

Major retailers explained manufacturers and paper industry executives are raising production to meet the demand,The New York Timesreported. Azar’s comments came as Trump declared a national emergency — “two very big words” — in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. He said the declaration would unlock about $50 billion in funding to aid the local, state and federal response to the virus. Trump also touted partnerships with various private corporations and laboratories to increase dramatically the scale of coronavirus testing nationwide, which has so far lagged demand and been plagued by problems. The president insisted this increase would begin in a matter of days. In California, New York and Washington state — where COVID-19 has spread quickly — officials have taken drastic measures to slow the rate of new infections. States like Maryland and Ohiohave followed suit, in a bid to prevent similar numbers of cases there. An emergency under the Stafford Act would allow the federal government to use its vast resources to support and cost-share with state and local governments. “An emergency declaration would allow a state to request a 75% federal cost-share for expenses that include emergency workers, medical tests, medical supplies, vaccinations, security for medical facilities, and more,” Bloomberg reported, citing congressional Democrats who have urged such a move.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Downton Abbey,Fleabag,The Americans,Communityand more also made the list If you came looking forBelow DeckorSouthern Charm, you’ve got the wrong list. (Although in that case what list could you be looking for?) This is our roundup of the best scripted shows of the decade, whether in comedy, drama or, as has happens frequently nowadays, both. Note: Shows that premiered before 2010 haven’t been included — so that leaves offMad Men,The Good WifeandBreaking Bad, all of which belong on a list of best shows ever. RELATED:The 10 Best TV Shows of the Year, According to PEOPLE’s Critic:Fleabag, The Crownand More! There’ll always be an England, or at least a really cozy facsimile to one, thanks to this beloved Masterpiece Theatre hit imported from the U.K. The first season, which involved smuggling a good-looking corpse out of Lady Mary’s (Michelle Dockery) bedroom, was wicked fun. Other seasons were generally less fun and less wicked, but always plushly snug and requiring an umbrella as insurance against tears.Downtonmade millions of Americans nostalgic for an existence they could never possibly have known or lived. Lena Dunham’s millennial comedy of manners was about a young Brooklyn woman’s unsentimental education: She and her three closest friends learned that what had seemed like an unbreakable bond was maybe just a temporary link forged by circumstance and convenience — a product of its moment. The show turned Williamsburg into hot real estate and, for many viewers, something like a state of mind. It also made a star out of a tall, lanky dude namedAdam Driver. TV finally found a way to rival those ginormous fantasy movie franchises, particularlyThe Lord of the Rings, and rapidly conquered all the realms of the world. (Secret sauce: a would-be empress with golden braids and pet dragons.) Since the show’s controversial finale, entertainment writers have been vigilantly scouting for whatever new series could be billed as “the nextGame of Thrones.” That, ironically, may turn out to be Amazon’s upcoming TV version ofThe Lord of the Rings. In the course of two short seasons — 12 episodes in all —Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who looks like a jauntier Virginia Woolf, explored the journey of a single Londoner who discovers the difference between misery caused by meaningless sex and anguish caused by romantic love. (The point is you’re better off suffering through the anguish than the misery.) For good measure, there were also an allegorical fox and guinea pig and a hot priest. Nothing in this paragraph conveys how funny the show was — it’s probably a bad idea to start out describing a comedy with a reference to Virginia Woolf. In its first season,Amy Poehler’s sitcom was treated, rather patronizingly, as a knockoff ofThe Office. But watered with care, skill and possibly love, the show grew into a kind, funny celebration of American life, in particular life in a Midwestern town where no one worries too much about the health effects of trans fats. Iconic bits: Ron Swanson’s (Nick Offerman)Pyramid of Greatnessand L’il Sebastian. The phenomenally popular Netflix horror series was a savvy pastiche/synthesis/reworking of mainstream 1980s pop-culture — everything from the mall as the high temple of middle-class life to hit movies about underdog kids overcoming otherworldly forces. The show somehow tapped into a motherlode of meaning while still managing to scare up essential scares: There were few things more weird or upsetting thanWinona Rydertrying to communicate with her missing son through Christmas lights. The retro-synth score was highly influential. Seinfeld’s hard-edged farcical humor has been an influence on a number of shows — including ABC’sHappy Endings, one of the decade’s better sitcoms — butSunnyhas been its most successful heir. The misadventures of a group of rather hostile friends at Paddy’s Pub, it’s now tied withOzzie and Harrietas television’s longest-running live-action comedy. It’s the strangest heir, too, with humor that thrives on shocking, low-aimed aggression. At random moments you may feel as if you’d turned over a shoebox and liberated a large, hairy-legged spider. Or (more whimsically and more cruelly)put socks on some poor cat. Shonda Rhimes’ breathless ABC hit about the ultimate Washington insider/broker (Kerry Washington) was the perfect show for our political decade, a time of unending campaigns and 24/7 crisis management. (Is there even such a thing as a non-crisis anymore?) The show burned through storylines faster than President Trump burns through chiefs of staff. Sort of a bookend toFleabag.Laura Dern, who could be described here as laceratingly funny yet devastatingly sad, gave arguably her best performance as a marketing executive who returns to work after a breakdown. She thinks group therapy in Hawaii has given her the zen calm to meet and override obstacles. This is one of many delusions.Enlightened, which was canceled after two seasons, is probably the only show ever to be both misanthropic and life-affirming. Co-creatorRyan Murphy’s anthology horror series, which circled through genre stories about witches, ghosts and killer clowns, sustained a tone both of queasy, gory suspense — isn’t cheap horror the best?! — and dry camp. It was a vile brew with a little cocktail mix thrown into the cauldron. It also featured a string of epic performances fromJessica Lange, who served as de factor leading lady. She managed to convey an eternity of damnation with just the words “knotty pine.” Murphy created another impressive anthology,American Crime Story, that also ranks among the decade’s standouts. The sitcom about a study group at Greendale Community College was a masterwork for nerds and twerps (which is another way of saying it struggled for five seasons before sputtering out on Yahoo). The show’s absurd but intricate inventiveness was unmatched, except possibly by NBC’sThe Good Place, which basically replaced college with the afterlife.Donald Glover, who became a TV groundbreaker with the greatAtlanta, playedLeVar Burton’s biggest fan. Favorite surreal gag:the pen-stealing monkey. This grim, powerful series had possibly the most inspired concept for any drama of the decade, and possibly also the trickiest: In the 1980s — just as the USSR is beginning its arduous descent into the dustbin of history — two married KGB spies (Matthew RhysandKeri Russell) set up shop in a suburb outside Washington, D.C. But husband and wife aren’t equally committed to the Motherland. In that case, can they be equally committed to each other? Or will an iron curtain of incompatibility separate them? The tensions between party loyalty and marital fidelity were drawn out with a suspense so fine it was almost granular. The show was likeMarriage Storyfor commies.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

He was elected prime ministerin July 2019. According to the BBC, Johnson now aims to continue as caretaker Prime Minister until the fall while the Conservative Party holds a leadership election across the summer. Johnson's resignation was largely prompted by the COVID-19 \"Partygate\" scandal, in which 16 social gatherings were found to have taken place in Downing Street during a 20-month period of various levels ofCOVID-related lockdownsin England. In April, Johnson, 58, wasfined by the Metropolitan Policefor the parties, becoming the first U.K. Prime Minister in history to be officially found to have broken the law. RELATED:Boris Johnson Survives Vote to Oust Him as British Prime Minister, but His Political Future Remains Uncertain In June, he alsosurvived a vote of confidenceamong his own members of parliament as a result of the investigation by 211 votes to 148 after an unknown number of Conservative MPs submitted letters stating they could no longer trust him to effectively run the U.K. government. This left Johnson in the position of governing the country without the support of a large percentage of his own lawmakers — a situation that ultimately led to the downfall of Conservative governments helmed by Margaret Thatcher, John Major and his predecessor,Theresa May. Johnson's premiership finally came to an end as a result of a scandal involving Conservative MP Chris Pincher, however, who was forced to resign as deputy chief whip of the Conservative Party afterbeing suspended for allegedly groping two menat the prestigious Carlton Club in London's upscale Mayfair neighborhood. \"I drank far too much,\" Pincher wrote to Johnson in his resignation letter on June 30. \"I've embarrassed myself and other people which is the last thing I want to do and for that I apologise to you and to those concerned.\" Yet it was Johnson's actions after Pincher's resignation that had the most impact, when it emerged thathe'd been warned that the MP had acted similarlybefore promoting him to government office. When questioned about whether he knew about the earlier allegations on July 1, a spokesperson for Johnson said he was not aware of \"specific allegations.\" On July 5, Lord McDonald, a former lead staffer in the Foreign Office, publicly refuted this, however, accusing Downing Street of \"not telling the truth.\" \"I briefed the relevant senior official in the Cabinet Office,\" he told theTodayprogram on BBC Radio 4. \"I know that the senior official briefed the prime minister in person because that official told me so at the time.\" Never miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletterto stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer. With the political pressure building, Johnson told the BBC that he \"bitterly\" regretted giving Pincher a government job. \"In hindsight, it was the wrong thing to do and I apologize to everyone who has been badly affected by it,\" he said. \"I just want to make absolutely clear that there's no place in this government for anybody who is predatory or abuses their position of power.\" RELATED:Boris Johnson Apologizes After Report Reveals 16 Office Parties Held During U.K. COVID Lockdown Ultimately, however, the combination of \"Partygate,\" Pincher and other scandals — such as Johnson refurbishing his Downing Street apartment with wallpaper costing $1,000 a roll — led to him losing the support of the public and his own government, evidenced by the resignation of two high-profile members of his inner circle on July 5. \"The public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously,\" Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak stated in his resignation letter on July 5. \"I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning.\" Sunak, who was previously in charge of the U.K.'s economy and effectively No. 2 in the government, added: \"Our people know that if something is too good to be true then it's not true. They need to know that whilst there is a path to a better future, it is not an easy one. I am sad to be leaving government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this.\" RELATED:Boris Johnson Faces Calls to Resign After Admitting He Attended Office Party During U.K. COVID Lockdown Health Minister Sajid Javid backed up this belief in his own resignation letter, writing \"We [the Conservative party] may not have always been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest. Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are now neither.\" \"It is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership and you have therefore lost my confidence,\" Javid told Johnson. On Thursday, Johnson's exit was hastened by the resignation of at least 50 ministers and aides from the U.K. government, including five ministers who urged Johnson \"to step aside\" in a combined resignation letter. Johnson also lost the support of key cabinet minister Michael Gove on Wednesday afternoon, his close friend and political sparring partner since their student days at Oxford University.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

A formal campaign launch in New Hampshire is scheduled for Tuesday evening. Christie, once a close ally ofDonald Trump, turned into critic of the former president near the end of his term in the White House, particularly following theJan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. He now aims to send voters a message that he is the only Republican challenger capable of handling Trump's attacks on the campaign trail — and fighting back. “You’re not going to beat someone by closing your eyes, clicking your heels together three times,” Christie recently told voters in New Hampshire,The Washington Postreports. “In American politics, if you want to beat somebody, you’ve got to go get them.” In 2020, after getting diagnosed withCOVID-19following awell-publicized \"super-spreader\"event at the Trump White House, Christie checked himself into Morristown Medical Center. Since he was at higher risk for coronavirus complications due to underlying health issues, including asthma, the hospital stay was meant as a precaution — though as Christie wrote in his 2021 book,Republican Rescue, it all felt \"very serious.\" In his book, Christie also wrote about that week spent in a hospital bed (a week when, he said, then-first ladyMelania Trumpchecked in on himevery day, while President Trump offered just one phone call — to see if he would be publicly blamed for Christie's sickness). Speaking to PEOPLE in a 2021 interview, Christie opened up about his time in the Trump White House and his frustration with the former president's focus on election conspiracy theories. \"Someone needed to stand up and say, 'Look, we need to get real and we need to start getting the job done because if we don't, we won't have a role in this country moving forward,'\" Christie said. He continued: \"I don't think people want to hear that any longer. I think people want a new day. There is a pathway to it.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The latest presidential election was awash in anti-government sentiment that often turned virulent. A new documentary airing Tuesday night on PBS shows that this brand of American outrage is nothing new. Oklahoma City,which airs Tuesdayon the PBS seriesAmerican Experience, casts the infamous bombing that killed 168 people and injured 675 others as part of a dark American tradition. “These sorts of movements have deep roots, very deep roots, in American history,” says Barak Goodman, the award-winning director whose film revisits the1995 Oklahoma City bombingwhen a former American soldier and Gulf War veteran, Timothy McVeigh, parked a rented truck carrying a five-ton fertilizer bomb outside of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building before walking away. Oklahoma Cityis a dual portrait of the lives lost and the violent governmental conflicts that fueled McVeigh’s rage against the United States. “The most important thing to understand about Timothy McVeigh is, he did not drop out of the sky,” says Goodman. “He was not a lone actor, in that he came from somewhere, his ideas came from somewhere. We want to trace those ideas back in history.” “There’s a lot of people, maybe even thousands of people, who at the time shared the same kind of rage and resentment and anger towards the federal government,” he says “Why does this person step out of the crowd? That’s the question.” “We’re not able to give a definitive answer, but certainly there are clues in McVeigh’s personality that make you understand why it might have been him and not someone else.” Goodman nods to earlier protest responses such as the 1920’s rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the 1950’s “Red Scare” of McCarthyism, and the 1960’s radical left that emerged from youth, race, class and war divisions. “This movement is an ongoing, very old aspect of American life,” he says. “It’s not going away, it never has gone away, it just flares up every few decades. Whether we’re seeing that now, I don’t know. No one knows. But it’s something to be aware of.” Oklahoma Citybuilds its narrative with a through-line that ties McVeigh’s disgruntled passion to a white-supremacist movement, the rise of anti-government militias, and the deadly standoffs between law enforcement and U.S. citizens atRuby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992, and theBranch Davidiancompound in Waco, Texas, in which 76 people died in 1993. (The director’s companion film,Ruby Ridge, will air Feb. 14 on PBS.) In a remarkable image, McVeigh is seen selling bumper stickers outside of the Branch Davidian complex during the 1993 federal siege there. “Fear the Government That Fears Your Gun,” says one. As international religious extremists such as ISIS command the spotlight and U.S. courts are wrestling with President Donald Trump’s order banning travelers from majority-Muslim countries, “law enforcement is aware of the threat of domestic terrorism,”Goodman says. “Oklahoma City was the seminal event in that learning curve. This isn’t new to them. They understand that threat.” Beyond its examination of the perpetrator, Goodman wants to put a face on the victims that McVeigh’s Oklahoma City attack affected most. “People think of the federal government as this monolithic thing,” says Goodman. “Who was McVeigh attacking? It was individual human beings, mothers, fathers, grandparents, just trying to do their jobs. The ‘federal government,’ quote unquote, goes on, but these people’s lives were ruined permanently.” McVeigh was convicted and executed in 2001 for the Oklahoma City bombing. Two others were convicted as conspirators: Terry Nichols is serving 161 life terms without parole; Michael Fortier, sentenced to 12 years, has since been released. Goodman, who began his film two years before the recent presidential election exposed hardening divisions among voters, drew upon some 60 hours of audio interviews conducted while McVeigh was on death row to complete his portrait. “I felt like I got to know him in some weird way,” he says. “He’s quite intelligent, and I think that’s a very common attribute for these kind of terrorists. But he had such an aggrandized view of himself and his destiny. It was so at odds with the reality. He thought of himself as being such a world-changing figure, and yet he was living such a small life.” Goodman recalls being struck by McVeigh’s “lack of remorse, the way he talked about people as ‘collateral damage,'” he says. McVeigh’s response to those who objected to his actions was that they should “get over it,” Goodman says. McVeigh’s dismissal, Goodman says, “was a chilling thing to hear.” Oklahoma Cityairs Tuesday (9 p.m. ET) on PBS.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Political experience used to be seen as an unofficial prerequisite for holding the highest office in the country. But after President Donald Trump was elected, the game has changed. Here’s a list of the celebrities and billionaires who may make a run — either seriously or jokingly — for Trump’s job in 2020. Oprah Winfrey Winfrey’s has people asking her to run for president for decades. But it was Trump’s election that opened her mind to the possibility. Previously, “I never thought about the question,” she said. “I never even considered the possibility. That’s what I thought.” But seeing Trump, a fellow TV star, settle into the Oval Office seemed to have her rethinking the idea. “I thought, oh gee, I don’t have the experience, I don’t know enough,” she said in an interview with David Rubenstein on Bloomberg. “Now I’m thinking, ‘Oh. Oh.’ ” That line set the Internet aflutter with the prospect of an Oprah 2020 campaign. However, Gayle King,CBS This Morninghost and Winfrey’s close friend, promptly shut down those rumors. “I would bet my first, second-born and any unborn children to come, that ain’t never happening,” she said. “Never. I’ll say never on this one. Nevah, N-E-V-A-H. Nevah.” Kanye West One of the first celebrities to declare his (potential) 2020 candidacy was West, who did so long before Donald Trump had won his first primary, let alone the 2016 election. At the end of a long speech accepting the Video Vanguard award, he announced his 2020 run. “And yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided, in 2020, to run for president,” he said. We haven’t heard anything since from West about a potential 2020 run, but hey, it’s still early. Chris Rock In the wake of the 2016 presidential election, a record number of people (in particular,women, according to NPR) have shown interest in running for office. One of these people is none other than the comedian, who announced on Twitter two days after the 2016 election that he’ll be running for president in 2020. I'm gonna run in 2020 wish me luck .pic.twitter.com/wkFCv7WrKB — Chris Rock (@chrisrock)November 10, 2016 Jury’s still out on whether or not he’s serious. Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson He’s already PEOPLE’s Sexiest Man Alive and one of the best-paid actors in Hollywood — could the White House be next? Inan interview with PEOPLE after being named Sexiest Man Alive, he said that he used to joke around about running for president, but each time he suggested the idea, he got more and more serious about it. “I used to say it jokingly but every time I was asked, it was with a real genuine interest. And it was very earnest,” he told PEOPLE. “And so I started to really think. Could I make a difference? Could I surround myself with really brilliant people to help me make decisions? Do I care about this country? And when the answers continued to come up yes, then I thought, there’s a good chance. Yeah, one day. Then we’ll do another interview like this.” Katy Perry Perry was a constant presence on the campaign trail with Hillary Clinton, campaigning for the eventual Democratic nominee before the primaries began. And perhaps all that political chatter got her thinking — why don’t I run for office myself? In July 2015, she posted an Instagram with Bill Clinton and George W. Bush with the caption “42, 43, 46?!” 42, 43, 46?! A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) onJul 26, 2015 at 9:00pm PDT If Perry were to run for president, one thing is quite likely: She’d run on a pro-Planned Parenthood platform. The singerdonated $10,000 to the organization after the 2016 election. Tom Hanks Though Hanks has never expressed any personal interest in running for office, film director Michael Moore thinks the Democratic party should try and entice him. Why? Because the American peopleloveTom Hanks. “Democrats would be better off if they ran Oprah [Winfrey] or Tom Hanks,”Moore told CNN after the 2016 election. “Why don’t we run beloved people? We have so many of them. The Republicans do this – they run [Ronald] Reagan and the Terminator [Arnold Schwarzenegger] and other people.” Will Smith After Trump’s divisive comments gained steam in the 2016 presidential race, Smith said that if this kinda of talk continued, he’d feel obligated to run for office. “If people keep saying all the crazy kinds of stuff they’ve been saying on the news lately about walls and Muslims, they’re going to force me into the political arena,” hesaid during an appearance onCBS This Morningin October 2016. “I mean, I gotta be the president … What else would I run for?” But for any would-be future Smith campaigners, it seems that he wasn’t entirely serious when he proposed the idea. Smithadmitted toEntertainment Tonightthat he was “kind of joking” when he said he’d run. However, don’t count Smith out of politics entirely — even if he doesn’t run for president, he hasn’t ruled out running for office one day. Hepreviously toldThe Hollywood Reporterthat he thinks there might be a place for him in politics. “As I look at the political landscape, I think that there might be a future out there for me. They might need me out there.” Bob Iger, CEO of Disney Trump hasn’t only inspired those in Hollywood to ponder a turn in the Oval Office. Many of Trump’s fellow big business billionaires are thinking the same. For starters, Iger, the CEO of Disney, said that many people — including a number of his Hollywood pals — have encouraged him to take a closer look at entering politics, and even towards a 2020 run. “A lot of people — a lot — have urged me to seek political office,”he toldThe Hollywood Reporter.According to the magazine, Iger has also consulted with former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg about the transition from corner office to public office. However, it’s not a sure thing just yet: Iger has said he’s open to staying on as Disney’s CEO after his contract expires in June 2018. Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks Schultz never strayed from getting political as the CEO of Starbucks, a position he stepped down from in December 2016. He was rumored to be thinking about throwing his name into the running back during the 2016 election, but eventually confirmed that he wouldn’t do so inan op-ed inThe New York Times. Then, he cited his loyalty to Starbucks, and the feeling that he wasn’t finished with his work there, as the reasons for his decision. But even as he declined running himself, Schultz encouraged those in government to work together across the aisle. RELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack “Despite the encouragement of others, I have no intention of entering the presidential fray. I’m not done serving at Starbucks,” Schultz wrote. “Americans who are tired of politics as usual should demand a clear answer to a simple question from every candidate: What will you do to unite all of us? The values of servant leadership — putting others first and leading from the heart — need to emerge from every corner of American life, including the business community.” Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook He’s the top guy at Facebook, which pretty much means Zuckerberg already runs the world. But does he have any plans to make it official with a 2020 presidential run? There are signs that point to yes:He set a 2017 goal of traveling to all 50 statesand meeting people in each one. Sounds sort of like a campaign, doesn’t it? And a small detail from a Facebook SEC filing in April 2016 pointed at another clue that they were preparing for a potential Zuckerberg political run. It read: “Mr. Zuckerberg’s leave of absence or resignation would not constitute a Voluntary Resignation if it were in connection with his serving in a government position or office.” Zuckerberg hasn’t commented himself on any political aspirations. FROM COINAGE: This Is How Much It Would Cost to Paint the White House (And More Crazy Facts) Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and Chairman of AXS TV Cuban and Trump’s disdain for one another is notorious. Cuban was one of Trump’s most vocal critics on the campaign trail, and now, it seems he’s open to the idea of going head to head with Trump in 2020. And if it happens, Trump has himself to thank for his competitor’s enthusiasm. Cuban said that Trump’s run convinced him that you no longer need to be a “perfect” candidate to be successful. “Well, it’s certainly more of a consideration than it was,” Cubansaid during an appearance onMeet the Pressin May 2016. “You don’t have to be the perfect Stepford candidate like you would’ve been in the past.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The 85-year-old veteran CBS newsmanannounced on his Facebook page on Thursday that he was hard at work on a book about patriotism, titledWhat Unites Us. “I want to share my sense of the basic tenets that I see as the foundation of the country I hold so dear. It is patriotism, as I define it, not as a divisive cudgel but a common purpose,”Rather wrote. “It is also a patriotism that will not ignore the sins of our nation, but challenge them honestly and head on. So in the book, I will be exploring themes that I see as fundamental to holding together this great experiment in democracy.” Set for publication this fall, the book was inspired by many of the conversations Rather had been having on social media in the wake of the 2016 presidential election. “As we all know, we live in turbulent and disorienting times. And yet conversing with all of you has renewed my optimism in this nation and its people,” he said. “I love the United States. I love the noble ideals under which it was founded. And I am in awe of the commitment of countless brave men and women who have toiled and sacrificed so that the truths we hold to be self-evident can be felt by all Americans – regardless of race, gender, religion (or lack thereof), and whom they choose to love, and how. It’s an imperfect journey, but we have come too far to give up the fight for justice.” Since the rise of now-President Donald Trump, Rather has been rather outspoken online —writing that Trump’s win“threatens to crumble some of the foundations of our democratic institutions.” He assured his readers, however, thatWhat Unites Uswill be “less tied to the headline of the moment.” FROM COINAGE: What Do You Do When Your Boss “Friends” You on Facebook? “…For this book I have tried to step back for a wider perspective,” he said. “I want to share my sense of the basic tenets that I see as the foundation of the country I hold so dear.

So in the book, I will be exploring themes that I see as fundamental to holding together this great experiment in democracy.” Rather’s publisher,Algonquin Books, describesWhat Unites Usas “a collection of wholly original essays” about “the institutions that sustain us, such as public libraries, public schools, and national parks; the values that have transformed us, such as the struggle for civil rights; and the drive towards science and innovation that have made the United States great.” What Unites Ushits shelves Nov. 7.Pre-ordersare now being accepted.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Sarah Krivanek's wellbeing remains a concern for activists and loved ones, heightened after an official saw the American woman's condition in person for the first time since she was imprisoned in Russia. Natalia Filimonova, a prisoner's rights activist working for nonprofit organization Russia Behind Bars, organized a visit from the state-run Prisoner Monitoring Service recently. She tells PEOPLE that foreign inmates do not have access to money and supplies from family and friends abroad \"so they find themselves in a critical situation if their health deteriorates.\" \"They don't have a Russian medical card and so they can't use the prison clinic,\" she says. \"When any inmate finds themselves in a state of crisis, that's the moment we go in to see them. If we didn't do this many people would perish in prison.\" Krivanek is serving a one-year, three-month sentence in connection with domestic assault charges that stemmed from a November 2021 dispute involving a Russian man named Mikhail Karavaev. She nicked him on the nose with a knife, which she claimed was after she was physically abused. After indicating in court that she was defending herself in the incident, Krivanek was released on bail. But while trying to flee Russia with the help of the U.S. Embassy on Dec. 15, 2021, Krivanek was arrested at a Moscow airport before she was able to board her U.S.-bound plane. A family member who Krivanek calls \"Nanny\" — and who asked to be named only as Caroline — tells PEOPLE, \"I worry about her day and night.\" Caroline has been like a mother to Sarah, who she says was hospitalized for near renal failure in the U.S. \"If she's not getting treatment, I'm afraid she's not going to make it,\" Caroline says. Anita Martinez, a close friend of Sarah's, has repeatedly written to the State Department through the White House website, urging them to visit her. A U.S. official told her in early August the State Department is \"very concerned\" and \"doing everything they can to ensure her well-being.\" But she's heard nothing more and Krivanek has yet to receive a visit from the embassy in Moscow, a four-hour drive from the colony. Viktor Boborykin, the Prisoner Monitoring Service official who visited Krivanek around Sept. 14, confirmed (via his colleague) to Russia Behind Bars that Sarah was in ill health, but gave no further details. The group works hand in hand with the Federal Penitentiary Service and is wary of any public criticism regarding conditions in prison. Russia Behind Bars also arranged a drop-off of fresh fruit and vegetables, vitamins, milk products, warm clothes and basic toiletries such as shampoo and soap through two local volunteers on Sept. 14. Krivanek had begged for the items in aprison-censored letterto a Russian contact. The volunteers who traveled from nearby Ryazan to deliver the goods in person were not permitted in to see her. \"They told us we needed proof of Covid vaccinations. But that wasn't posted as a requirement on the prison site,\" explains one of them, Ekaterina Vulikh. \"The last three kilometers [to get to the penal colony] was just a dirt track,\" Vulikh says. \"It's in the middle of nowhere. It's strange when you approach because you come upon this old, dilapidated set of Soviet-era buildings ringed by barbed wire. There's complete silence.\" An online review site of Prison Colony No. 4 in the Ryzansk region describes the appalling conditions. \"The food has maggots and cockroaches in it and if you open your mouth to complain you're sent to the Shizo [isolation cell],\" writes Viktoria Naklonova. \"In Winter the cold is unbearable…In a word, it's hell there.\" Yekaterina, a relative of an inmate, writes: \"There is absolutely no medical help here, my relative had open ulcers on her legs and she wasn't even given a bandage.\" Another relative, Alexei Ivanov, said: \"The only way to survive here is if you have money.\" Never miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletterto stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer. Svetlana Gorbacheva, a lawyer for Krivanek who has received two distressed phone calls from her client since December, has personally sent her money. She knows that friends and family are unable to transfer funds into Russia following the war in Ukraine. \"I feel so sorry for her,\" she says. \"She desperately needs help. She's sitting waiting for someone from the Embassy to come.\" The Russian judicial service \"asked constantly\" for a representative of the U.S. Embassy to be present at her trial but \"they didn't respond at all,\" she adds. A U.S. State Department official told PEOPLE in early August, \"We take our role in assisting U.S. citizens abroad seriously and are monitoring the situation.\" The department did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for further comment Monday. Filimonova from Russia Behind Bars was surprised that Boborykin's visit was attended by a prison guard and a priest — those meetings are supposed to be private. \"We stressed that it had to be a one-to-one confidential meeting so that we could get information on how she really feels, what her conditions are and what medicines she needs.\" She believes the guard was present because she's an American citizen. She adds that Krivanek had been in the prison system long enough to \"understand the dangers of saying anything that could get her into trouble.\" Krivanek is due to be released on Nov. 11 and then deported, but her lawyer insists that the deportation process \"is to be avoided at all costs.\" Unlike the U.S., the Russian government does not pay deportation costs and foreigners convicted of crimes are kept in a holding cell until they can organize their own trip home. \"Normally what should happen is that the Embassy makes contact with the prison administration and arranges for conditions of her release,\" adds her lawyer. Filimonova says she knows of foreigners who've been in a detention cell for up to a year while they try and raise funds for a flight home. Krivanek will be penniless upon her release and likely still unable to contact friends and family from her cell. \"We will try and get one of our volunteer lawyers to take on this case and see if we can avoid deportation,\" she says. \"If that isn't successful, we can help arrange her flight home.\" Meanwhile, Martinez says she's happy that people are finally paying attention to her dear friend. \"I'm eternally grateful for the help shown by these brave Russian volunteers who've arranged for potentially life-saving supplies to be sent to Sarah,\" she says. \"And to PEOPLE for establishing contact with them.\" Filimonova agrees that you have to be \"a courageous person\" to come to the aid of an American prisoner inVladimir Putin's Russia. On Sept. 12, Martinez sent another letter to PresidentJoe Biden, which she shared with PEOPLE. She begs him to show Krivanek the same attention he has given to WNBA playerBrittney Griner, who is also imprisoned in Russia and is now awaiting news on theappeal of her nine-year sentencefor drug possession. Biden recentlymet with Griner's family membersat the White House to assure them that her case is still a top priority for the administration. Martinez has yet to hear back from the president regarding Krivanek. \"Please do not let her die in a Russian prison!\" she writes. \"She said that she feels abandoned by the U.S. Government. Please do something to let her know that this is not the case and that she has not been forgotten. Do right by her and bring her home before it's too late.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

A Pennsylvania native who developed a passion for performing and songwriting early on in life, Moore joined her first band in high school.

In addition to reveling in her love of music, the performer has also been candid in interviews about her troubling past. “I was extreme. I went through phases from skateboarder, to hip-hopper, to rave child, to lead singer in a band. I did it all, and all at the same time,” she previously said, adding that she hadexperimented with hard drugsby the time she turned 15. Shortly after forming R&B group Choice in 1995, Pink and her bandmates signed onto a record label with the help of famed music executive L.A. Reid. However, the band split in 1998 after Pink was offered a solo deal. Pink made her big solo debut in 2000 withCan’t Take Me Home, her first album following her band’s breakup. Pink cemented her pop-punk status after covering “Lady Marmalade” alongside Christina Aguilera, Lil’ Kim and Mya for theMoulin Rouge!soundtrack in 2001. The foursome earned a Grammy Award the next year for their performance. The honor served as Pink’s first-ever Grammy nomination and subsequent win. In 2001, Pink released her second studio album,Misundaztood, which was met with critical acclaim and launched the singer into superstardom. The tracks off the singer’s sophomore album recount dark tales of Pink’s childhood, ranging from her rebellious teen years to her parents’ tumultuous split. “I accept the challenge that kids are gonna be relating to me moreso than a lot of people because I am telling the truth and I’ve been there,”Pink revealed in an interview. Her next album, 2003’sTry This, boasted the single “Feel Good Time,” which was featured on the soundtrack ofCharlie’s Angels: Full Throttle— alongside a cameo by Pink in the film’s motocross scene. All she does is win! In 2004, Pink was awarded her second Grammy for her song, “God Is a DJ,” off herTry Thisalbum. Four years after meeting at the 2001 X Games, Pink and pro biker Carey Hart took their relationship to the next level when the singer proposed to her longtime boyfriend during his 2005 motocross race. The pair tied the knot in Costa Rica the next year. Marriage is work – as Pink and her motocross hubby proved to be true when they split after two years of marriage in 2008 (without officially divorcing) only to begin “dating” again in 2009. They’ve been together ever since. In case you needed yet another reason to admire Pink: the performer proved she’s multitalented outside of singing and songwriting withher aerial performance at the 2010 Grammys. Pink and Hart welcomed their first child, daughter Willow, in 2011. “What scares me more is having a breakable child,”she toldE! Newsof Willow back in 2015. “She needs to be out in the world and be able to do things for herself. She’s very capable, she’s very physical.” Pink added: “I started out with her where I was gonna get her a bubble and never let her out of it but, you know, she’s good.” In 2012, the new mom took on yet another role, signing on to become a spokesmodel for CoverGirl. Pink’s campaign tagline rang true to the singer’s signature vibe: “Beauty with an edge.” Taking a brief departure from her edgy pop sound, Pink recorded a folk music album calledRose Ave., a collaborative effort with longtime friend and musician Dallas Green. The album was released in 2014 under the band name You+Me. Déjà vu! Pink took on yet another impressive feat when shegave an acrobatic performanceduring the 2014 Grammys while simultaneously belting out “Just Give Me a Reason.” In 2015, Pink was honored at the 63rd Annual BMI Awards with the President’s Award for “her outstanding achievement in songwriting and global impact on pop culture and the entertainment industry.” Pink took to the stage todeliver her acceptance speech, saying: “I’ve always tried to be uncomfortably honest — to the point of oversharing — in my career, and I think for that reason my fans have always said to me, instead of ‘I want to be just like you,’ they say, ‘Thank you for helping me want to be more like myself,’ or ‘Man, I thought I was the only person who felt that way.’ And to that I say, ‘Me too.’ “ In 2016, Pink and Hart became second-time parents with the birth of their son, Jameson Moon. “He’s delicious,”Pink told host Ellen DeGeneresin a phone call on her show, following her son’s arrival. As for how Willow is feeling about her little brother? “I literally put Jameson down when she walks in the room,” Pink shared. “[Willow is] a little weepy these days so we’re working it out.” Ahead of the MTV Video Music Awards, it was announced thatPink would receive this year’s Video Vanguard Award, an honor that has been awarded to Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Kanye West and Rihanna in recent years. Arriving at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards with Hart and Willow in matching suits, Pink delivered a career-spanning performance at the ceremony, ending the medley with an inspiring acceptance speech about self-acceptance. “Baby girl, we don’t change,” Pink said,addressing her daughter in the audience. “We take the gravel in the shell and make a pearl. We help other people to change, so they can see all kinds of beauty.” In April 2018,Pink was announced as the cover star on PEOPLE’s annual Beautiful Issue, where she opened up about raising son Jameson, 16 months, and daughter Willow, 6½. In the interview, she makes a point of never “talking down” to her children while explaining there are rules and consequences. “I’m a tough mama,” she told PEOPLE. “I expect a lot. Ihave a high bar for myselfand for others, and it’s not easy to be loved by me. But [Willow] gets it and she’s smart, and thoughtful because of it.” The singer found herself in hot water in August 2018 whenphotographs of her and her children relaxing at a Byron Bay beachwere spread by Australian tabloids. Pink, who was diagnosed with a gastric virus a few days later, had postponed the first Sydney date of herBeautiful Trauma World Tourdue to an upper respiratory infection. With critics claiming Pink had been lying about her health, the “So What” songstress set the record straight on Instagram — explaining that she was only clearing this up “out of respect” for her fans. “This break in Byronhas been scheduled since 2017, as a way to get outside the hotel and the winter and have some time with my children,” Pink said. “I’ve already been sick twice (kids as well) on this Australian tour, but the first time we got sick, I was able to push through. This time, what these parasite paparazzi don’t show you, is two doctor visits in Byron on two consecutive days, antibiotics, steroids, Vick’s, nose spray, throat spray, more steroids, NyQuil, a screaming baby in the middle of the night, every night, while mama gives him warm baths and tells her daughter everything is fine.” Before hitting it big in the music industry as Pink, the future Grammy winner was born Alecia Beth Moore. A Pennsylvania native who developed a passion for performing and songwriting early on in life, Moore joined her first band in high school. Moore was inspired to take on a stage name after watching Quentin Tarantino’sReservoir Dogs, which featured the character Mr. Pink. In addition to reveling in her love of music, the performer has also been candid in interviews about her troubling past. “I was extreme. I went through phases from skateboarder, to hip-hopper, to rave child, to lead singer in a band. I did it all, and all at the same time,” she previously said, adding that she hadexperimented with hard drugsby the time she turned 15.

Fraserhad to have facial reconstruction surgerywhile Mason was removed from the bench. Mason was also a former state representative and state senator. After serving nine months, Mason was granted judicial release. In a letter written to Fraser as part of his petition for early release, Mason apologized for his actions. “My responsibility was to love and protect you,” Mason wrote, Cleveland.com reports. “Instead of loving, protecting and providing for you and our daughters, I have provided a terrible example, and exposed you to rage and violence.” Following his release from prison, he was hired by the Cleveland mayor’s office in an administrative position.

PresidentDonald Trump‘s eldest daughter and a senior aide, Ivanka has focused on less polarizing policies than her father. She has become one of the government’s faces on workforce and family economic issues. But that has not separated her from the daily criticism of the president. Detractors routinely accuse her of hypocrisy, pointing to her insistence that she does not always agree with her dad but continues to work in the White House while sharing any differing opinions with him privately. RELATED:Ivanka & Jared ‘Aren’t Good People,’ Meghan McCain Says After Report of Trump Infighting — as White House Hits Back Her Tuesday speech at CES was yet another example of how the Trump name — which the president successfully turned into an anti-immigration firebrand — now almost automatically injects politics into any situation. Ivanka’s keynote focused on teaching blue collar employees new tech skills to help them keep up in the workforce,The Washington Postreported. She is the co-chair of the National Council for the American Worker. “Ivanka is not a woman in tech,” video game developer and Democratic congressional candidate Brianna Wutweeted on Sunday, along with a link toan op-edcriticizing the decision. Wu wrote that Ivanka, 38, “has no background. It’s a lazy attempt to emulate diversity – but like all emulation it’s not quite the real thing.” “She would not be welcomed in women in tech circles because her politics harm everything we fight against in our careers. #CES should be ashamed of itself,” Wu tweeted. “There are thousands of qualified women working at major companies that could deliver a keynote,” she wrote, adding, “Ivanka is not one of us.” CES has come under fire in recent years for its lack of women represented in keynotes, including back-to-back years in 2016 and 2017 where the conference didn’t host a single woman to give a speech, according toThe Guardian. The conference has also been criticized for featuring provocatively dressed women at company booths to draw attention among the mostly male crowd. Ivanka’s CES keynote was reportedly met with some applause.

After an official introduction, Meghan made her way to the stage as fans cheered and snapped photos. Kate Robertson, one of the two founders, was ready to greet her onstage — and dipped down to give a curtsy. However, the royal mom approached Robertson, whom she has known for the past five years, with her arms outstretched and appeared to shake her head no, instead embracing her in a friendly hug. In a video from the event posted on Meghan andPrince Harry‘s joint Instagram page, the royal can be seen clapping along to a musical performance as participants waved flags from around the world.

Cooper, 52, had taken issue with Trump's decision to pose for a photo while holding a bible in front of St. John's Episcopal Church in downtown Washington, D.C., amid the protests on Monday night.

No one in charge stood up to save America.” RELATED:Governors Respond to Trump's Call to 'Dominate' Protesters and His Threat to Send in the Military Carlson hardly spoke of the outragefollowing George Floyd's death in Minneapoliswhile in in police custody last week, after an officer knelt on his neck for minutes while he pleaded for air. Instead, Carlson wanted to talk about the people involved in destruction and looting. He called Trump’s response “the singular test of his presidency.\" \"The first requirement of leadership is that you watch over people in your care, it’s what voters demand from their president,” Carlson said. “But if you do not protect them, or worse, you seem like you can’t be bothered to protect them, then you’re done … people will not forgive weakness.” Carlson, 51, also showed footage of Fox News reporter Leland Vittert, who was chased and shouted at by protestors near the White House this weekend. “That was in Lafayette Square in the center of our capital city,” Carlson said. “If you can’t keep a Fox News correspondent from getting attacked directly across from your house, how can you protect my family? How are you going to protect the country? How hard are you trying?” With the general election a mere five months away, Trump has doubled down on his “law and order” stance as a juxtaposition to rival and presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nomineeJoe Biden, who he’sslammed as“weak, both mentally and physically.” He’s also seemed to relish the idea of violently suppressing protestors, tweeting over the weekend that the Secret Service could have unleashed “vicious dogs” on the crowd outside the White House. The same night both Cooper and Carlson criticized him, the president, 73, addressed the protests from the White House Rose Garden, threatening to send the military into communities who didn’t corral people to his satisfaction. He said he had instructed governors to \"deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets.\" RELATED:Powerful Images from Protests Across the U.S. Over George Floyd's Death Protests have erupted across the country following Floyd's death last week, with several large cities instituting curfews to try to curb the unrest. Biden and other leaders, including Atlanta MayorKeisha Lance Bottomsand Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, denounced Trump for what they said were inflammatory comments. \"Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,\" Biden, 77,said at a meetingin Delaware with community leaders Monday morning. Referring to Trump's trip to the church by the White House on Monday, the former vice president said, “I just wish he opened it [the Bible] once in a while instead of brandishing it.\" \"If he opened it, he could’ve learned something,\" Biden said in a speech on Tuesday. \"We’re all called to love one another as we love ourselves.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: As soon as news broke Wednesday that Supreme Court JusticeStephen Breyer will retire, speculation began about who PresidentJoe Bidenwill nominate to replace the liberal-leaning jurist. At her daily briefing, Press SecretaryJen Psakianticipated a barrage of such questions — and she was not wrong in her assumption — but preemptively hedged them by saying the White House won't comment on details of the president's decision-making process. After all, she noted, Justice Breyer hasn't officially announced his departure from the court. \"Let me reiterate something that you heard the President say, and I also said over Twitter: 'It's always been the decision of any Supreme Court Justice if and when they decide to retire, how they want to announce it, and that remains the case today,' \" Psaki said. Still, there were questions. \"Does President Biden plan to honor his pledge to nominate a Black woman to the Court?\" a reporter asked. \"Hypothetically\" was thrown in, prompting some laughter among the assembled press. RELATED:Biden's First Judicial Picks Include Black Woman Viewed as His Potential Supreme Court Nominee \"Well, I've commented on this previously. The president has stated and reiterated his commitment to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court and certainly stands by that,\" Psaki replied. \"For today, again, I'm just not going to be able to say anything about any specifics until, of course, Justice Breyer makes any announcement, should he decide to make an announcement.\" (Soon enough, the White House announced that Biden would make a speech Thursday afternoon about Breyer's retirement, with Breyer in attendance.)

The reporter pushed: \"Doesn't every White House like to get ahead of this in case of a sudden passing — in the case of Ruth Bader Ginsburg?\" Psaki didn't budge. But then the same reporter posed another question. \"Is there any scenario in which the President would select his vice president,Kamala Harris, for the Supreme Court?\" Harris is the first Black woman to serve as vice president. She's also Asian American, a lawyer and the former attorney general of California. \"Again, I'm not going to speak to any considerations, preparations, lists. And as we've stated earlier, and you heard the president say: There's a long history of Supreme Court justices determining when they may retire, if they retire, and announcing that. That remains the case today,\" Psaki said. But the White House press corps dug in: A third reporter followed-up on the Harris question, which was the subject of various grabby-if-wildly-speculative headlines on Thursday — such as \"Kamala Harris to Supreme Court Would Open the VP Door for Hillary Clinton\"fromTheBoston Herald. \"When you were asked about the vice president possibly being selected as a Supreme Court nominee,\" another reporter asked, \"you said you're 'not going to speak to any considerations.' Does that mean she is being considered?\" Psaki dodged, so the reporter re-phrased. \"Just wondering, hypothetically and theoretically, would someone who was an attorney general of a large state and who served with many keys Senate votes be an attractive candidate to the president for an open Supreme Court seat?\" RELATED:Joe Biden Reaffirms Kamala Harris Will Be His 2024 Running Mate \"I see what you did there,\" Psaki said, prompting more laughter. \"But the president has every intention, ashe said before, of running for re-election, and for running for re-election with Vice President Harris on the ticket as his partner.\" There were a couple more Supreme Court-related questions, but Psaki stuck to her refusal to comment in detail about Biden's thinking or preparation. At one point, when she called on a reporter who indicated two questions were coming, Psaki asked, \"Is it about the Supreme Court?\" The reporter replied: \"No, I'm not part of this bunch.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Chicago's St. Patrick's Day celebrations are some of the most talked-about in the nation – and they have 50 lbs. of green dye to thank for it. Every year, the city dyes the Chicago River green for the holiday and the epic bashes held in honor of it, including a parade and weekend-long parties around town. Boston is often referred to as America's most Irish city, and it's a title its inhabitants strive to be worth of every St. Paddy's Day. Bostonians kick off each March 17 with a breakfast for the city's politicians, follow it with one of the country's biggest parades (second only to New York City) and finish it off with a concert from Celtic rock group Dropkick Murphys at the House of Blues. You wouldn't think so, but Savannah, Georgia, has a surprisingly long tradition of celebrating St. Patrick's Day in a big way. A parade takes center stage, but the fun doesn't stop once the floats have passed: March 17 is basically one massive party, complete with crushing crowds and plenty of green beer (for adults, not puppies and children). N.Y.C. residents have long claimed that they have the best of everything: bagels, theater, pizza and, of course, the best St. Patrick's Day parade. While other cities might argue otherwise, Manhattan's parade is in fact the world's biggest, officially making it the one to beat. A century ago, England and Ireland were at each other's throats in the fight for Irish independence. But as London's modern-day St. Patrick's Day festivities show, the hatchet has long been buried: The city hosts a parade that ends in Trafalgar Square, where parade-goers spend the rest of the day celebrating at a festival and concert. St. Patrick's Day may be a holiday that celebrates the Irish, but the American capital still gets amped for it. Even the President goes green for St. Paddy's, as seen every year in the fountain on the White House's South Lawn, dyed green for the day. How could we forget the mother country?According toTravel & Leisure, the Irish don't get too too crazy on the holiday — a day off, as it's a bank holiday — choosing to celebrate at Dublin's big parade and over dinner and drinks with friends. Pisa, Italy is a relatively small city, but it does St. Patrick's Day in a big way: The leaning tower, Pisa's very recognizable monument, gets the green treatment in the holiday's honor.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Shortly after the attack,President Donald Trumpwas briefed on the incident, according to Press Secretary Sean Spicer. The NYPD’s counter-terrorism unit has said police were monitoring the attack and have deployed long-gun teams to beef up security outside the British Consulate, City Hall and other major landmarks in N.Y.C.

Harrington added that police “response will be ongoing for some time as it’s important that we gather all evidence.” London Ambulance Servicesaid in a statementthat the first response crew arrived within six minutes of being called, and declared the situation a “major incident.” Eyewitness Kevin Schofield told the BBC that he was first alerted to the incident when he “heard a long bang outside – like a car crash.” “I looked out of the window and it was pretty chaotic. There were people running around, there was shouting,” said Schofield. “I looked down to my left at Old Palace Yard, which is normally blocked of by armed police, and I saw a man sort of forcing his way through. One police officer went down under his attack and another police officer came to his aid. That’s when the assailant got up with his arm outstretched.” He continued, “He had something in his hand… He then walked towards the policeman. I couldn’t quite see what happened. The next thing I heard – within 10 seconds – was the sound of gunfire and that was obviously when we realized that something very, very serious had happened.” Parliament is on lockdown, and the Westminster underground station has been temporarily shut down, according totransit authorities.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Michael Davenport, the former bassist of The Ataris, has been charged with federal fraud and conspiracy charges for running a nationwide telemarketing real estate scam which brought in $27 million over a seven-year period. Davenport — who currently plays in Versus The World — served as a bassist in the Indiana band from 1998 to 2005, before returning to perform with The Ataris for their reunion shows in 2013 and 2014. As reported by theSanta Barbara Independent,Davenport was indicted last month along with Cynthia Rawlinson. If convicted, they both face more than 30 years in prison for conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, five counts of wire fraud, and one count of mail fraud. According to the indictment, Davenport started a Santa Barbara-based telemarketing company called American Standard (one of over a dozen names used) in 2009. The company allegedly placed advertisements displaying “pre-foreclosure” homes at below-market costs. The details of the properties could be viewed for a $199 fee, with the ads also claiming that, according to the indictment, “customers could purchase the houses by simply taking over the homeowners’ mortgage payments, and the deeds to these homes would then be transferred into the customers’ names.” It’s alleged that once victims of the scam became aware that the properties were not for sale — or, in some cases, didn’t even exist at the address listed — their requests for a refund were met by a 90-day waiting order from American Standard. The indictment goes on to allege that when that period of time had passed, victims then had to mail a refund request along with copies of letters from the owners of the property proving that it had been incorrectly listed. Most refunds were never issued as a result of the alleged scam. RELATED VIDEO: The Coachella Lineup Is Finally Here!

Another $850,000 has reportedly been seized from Davenport’s bank accounts. Both Davenport and Rawlinson will appear in court to be arraigned on January 17.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The threatening language used by the man in the footage was directed at Sen. Chuck Schumer and Reps.Nancy Pelosi, Jerry Nadler andAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \"There's no escape, Pelosi, Schumer, Nadler. We're coming for you,\" he says as a crowd marches toward the Capitol. \"We're coming in like white on rice for Pelosi, Nadler, Schumer — even you, AOC. We're coming to take you out and pull you out by your hairs. How about that, Pelosi?\" The video compilation released by the Jan. 6 committee also contains surveillance footage that apparently shows the same man inside the Capitol complex the day before, taking pictures with his phone. \"Individuals on the tour photographed and recorded areas of the complex not typically of interest to tourists, including hallways, staircases, and security checkpoints,\" Committee Chairman Bennie Thompsonsaid in a press releaseWednesday, renewing a request for Loudermilk to provide information to the panel for its investigation of the attack and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results to keepDonald Trumpin the White House. Rep. Loudermilk is also seen in the footage. RELATED:5 Key Moments from the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot Hearing, from Never-Before-Seen Video to Ivanka Trump's Testimony The Georgia lawmaker previously acknowledgedhe welcomed people into parts of the Capitol complexon Jan. 5, when it was closed due to pandemic restrictions, but denied it was for a \"reconnaissance tour.\" \"A constituent family with young children meeting with their Member of Congress in the House office buildings is not a suspicious group or 'reconnaissance tour.' The family never entered the Capitol building,\" Loudermilk said in a statement in May. RELATED:Capitol Police Officer Testifies About the 'Carnage' of Jan. 6: 'I Was Slipping in People's Blood' \"No place that the family went on the 5th was breached on the 6th, the family did not enter the Capitol grounds on the 6th, and no one in that family has been investigated or charged in connection to January 6th,\" the statement also said. Asked by reporters Wednesday whom he gave a tour to on Jan. 5, 2021,Loudermilk said, \"It was a family and some guests of folks that they brought from Georgia.\" \"I don't know him. I've never met him before,\" he added of the man in the video. Loudermilk was also asked about the claim that the man took photos of security checkpoints in a basement and of a stairwell. The lawmaker said he brought the visitors to those areas because the children in the group \"wanted to see the little trains\" — referring to the Capitol subway system that takes lawmakers to and from their offices and congressional chambers — and a \"golden eagle sconce on the wall\" in the stairwell. \"They're not interested in the truth. They're only interested in creating a narrative for [the media],\" Loudermilk said of the committee, adding that his office never received a letter requesting his cooperation. \"There's nothing there.\" RELATED:Capitol Riot Investigation Finds Evidence of 'a Lot More than Incitement' from Trump, U.S. Reps Claim Loudermilk also mentioned that the Capitol Police examined surveillance video and determined that there was nothing suspicious about the tour he led. \"There is no evidence that Representative Loudermilk entered the U.S. Capitol with this group on January 5, 2021,\" Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said earlier this week in a letter to the top Republican on the House Administration Committee,The Washington Postreported. \"We train our officers on being alert for people conducting surveillance or reconnaissance, and we do not consider any of the activities we observed as suspicious.\" Loudermilk is a member of the House Administration Committee, which previously said a review of security footage determined there were \"no tours, no large groups, no one with MAGA hats on\" that were captured by cameras. However, Chairman Thompson and the committee vice chair, Republican Rep.Liz Cheney, said in the May letter to Loudermilk that the Jan. 6 investigation's \"review of evidence directly contradicts that denial.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

There are several real left-wing internet or radio shows named some variation of Resistance Radio, or which were using the hashtag #resistanceradio before Amazon became involved.

FROM COINAGE: This Is How Much It Would Cost to Paint the White House (And More Crazy Facts) That could be considered a dig at pro-Trump news outlets like Breitbart. Former Breitbart head and current lead Trump adviser Steve Bannon once declared the outlet a “platform for the alt-right,” which includes white nationalist and neo-Nazi elements. So Trump supporters aren’t entirely tilting at windmills here. At least on Twitter, #resistanceradio really is a stream of left-wing conversation, and Amazon is at least hinting at parallels between Trump supporters and Nazis. That’s not entirely surprising, considering that Amazon head (andWashington Postowner) Jeff Bezos was one of President Trump’s most persistent and powerful critics during last fall’s campaign.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Among the guests was Pikotaro, the famed creative force behind the “Pen Pineapple Apple Pen” song. (Last November, Ivanka Trumpposted a video to Instagramof her then-5-year-old daughter Arabella singing her own version of the song. The video was retweeted byJustin Bieber, helping launch the song into the category of viral sensation. A month later, when Abe met with Trump and Ivanka in New York, he told the president that he had seen Arabella’s interpretation.) Pikotaro, donned in leopard-print robes and sporting his signature thin mustache, socialized with other attendees and confirmed that he had not yet met Ivanka. During toasts, Abe heralded the success of “golf diplomacy” with Trump, while the president shared a story about how their relationship got off to a “rocky start.” “So my relationship with Shinzo got off to quite a rocky start because I never ran for office, and here I am. But I never ran, so I wasn’t very experienced,” Trump said. “And after I had won, everybody was calling me from all over the world. I never knew we had so many countries.” The remark drew instant backlash on Twitter. When Obama said he visited 57 states it was a huge gaffe.

Bush’s twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, for example, have as passionately protected Barron’s privacy as they have that of Sasha and Malia Obama. Jenna Bush Hager told PEOPLE in a recent interview thatthe internet attacks against Barronmake her “mad” because “the truth is, obviously, Barron Trump didn’t ask his dad to run for president. It wasn’t his decision.” “And the same with Malia and Sasha and Chelsea and all of us,” she said. “We’re supportive of our parents, but it’s a job without guidelines, and it’s one that none of us asked for, specifically.” “I think kids should be allowed to be kids,” she added.

In 2015, the organization clarified that disease names should not focus in on geographic locations. Trump had used the term “Chinese Virus” inmany of his tweetsover the last week and has made a point to repeatedly mention that the virus came from China during press briefings, despite widespread backlash and the reluctance of some of his own aides to use similar language. There have beenmultiple reported instances of violence against Asiansin various countries in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus, underlining the risk of attaching a virus or disease to a particular country or ethnicity. At a coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Trump defended his choices after a reporter asked him if he was concerned about the harm it may bring on Asian Americans. “It’s not racist at all. No. Not at all,” Trump said. “It comes from China. That’s why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.” “I have great love for all of the people from our country,” Trump continued. “But, as you know, China tried to say at one point — maybe they stopped now — that it was caused by American soldiers. That can’t happen. It’s not going to happen, not as long as I’m president. It comes from China.” At that briefing, Trump was also asked about an unnamed White House official who, according to CBS reporter Weijia Jiang,called it the “Kung flu” to herin private.

Yang, the president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, told NBC News. “Certainly use of this term by him and others even in the last couple of weeks have led to a noticeable incline in hate incidents that we are seeing. I do think that there is a correlation.” A New York lawmaker told NBC that Trump’s language was “fueling xenophobia.” “To continue calling COVID-19 the ‘Chinese virus,’ is to basically be racist,” said Yuh-Line Niou, a member of the New York assembly. “It’s fueling the xenophobia we’re seeing all over our districts.” As information about the coronavirus pandemic rapidly changes,PEOPLEis committed to providing the most recent data in our coverage.

At the top of that ticket is Democratic presidential nomineeJoe Biden, who Common believes will \"change the tone and energy\" of the country if elected — compared to the current commander-in-chief. \"What we’ve experienced over the past four years has been one of the greatest debacles that I’ve ever seen in my life,\" the Grammy- andOscar-winning rapper, actor and activist tells PEOPLE. \"And also one of the greatest times of dissension and division ... And I believe nothing has changed for the positive for the everyday person.\" Common, 48, spoke with PEOPLE on Monday about his recent time on the trail: what he's seen, what he's learned and what motivates him to back Biden despite the latter’s flaws. He is now in Columbia, South Carolina, where's he's performing for volunteers of theJaime Harrisoncampaign. (Harrison is running a hotly-contested campaign against incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham.) Common has also spent part of his time in the South encouraging people to vote. Earlier this week, he canvassed in and around Miami alongside two Latina candidates: Daniella Levine Cava and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Spending time with candidates who work to forge personal connections to their potential constituents, says the rapper, is eye-opening. \"They've really showed me what I think the political system has potential to be,\" he says. \"When you're thinking about being in leadership, you want to connect with all the people that you may potentially be leading so you can actually be serving.\" REVEALED:Common Reveals He Was Molested In New Book — and Actress Laura Dern Helped Him Remember That attitude, he says, has been sorely lacking from administration ofPresident Donald Trump, who has long favored personal insults and fierce, all-caps attacks on social media. \"The energy and the way the leadership has been for the past four years ... the anxiety and depression that’s been a result of it ... I’ve gotta do everything and anything to make sure that I will support someone who will change the tone and spirit and energy and [turn the country] to a new direction,\" Common says. That's why he's supporting Biden for president. Biden, he says, isn't perfect — but the former vice president will work to change the tone of the country. \"To be honest, Joe Biden made mistakes like any other human being,\" Common says. \"But I still believe he cares and we've all made bad decisions. He has the leadership qualities to get [the country] in a better direction.\" \"[Biden] is looking and seeking and thinking about the people who are overlooked ... about Black and brown people and creating jobs for them,\" he continues. Biden has previously faced criticism forblundersmade when discussing race and he was challenged on remarks he made about school desegregation during the second Democratic presidential debate, after he recounted \"civil\" working relationships with segregationist senators. Sen.Kamala Harrisconfronted Biden directly by offering a moving anecdote of her own experience being bussed to school in 1970s California. Ultimately, Biden chose Harris as his running mate, a move that supporters saidsignaled Biden's commitmentto putting in substantive work when it comes to issues of racial inequities and policing. Common says that Biden's selection of Harris, the first Black woman and person of Asian descent on a major presidential ticket in the U.S., is indicative of the former vice president's willingness to change and grow over time. \"I want to be clear: This man is not perfect ... But having a partner [like Harris] in his ear will be helpful, too,\" Common says. \"I want to see people in better conditions and living better lives. We cannot allow Donald Trump to be in office again. Around the world, we’re looking crazy.\" The persistent negative messaging from Trump, in Common's view, has not just changed the country's reputation on the world stage. He says it has also impacted those in lower-income communities. While canvassing in low-income communities in places like South Florida and South Carolina, the rapper-actor says he's met people from all walks of life. \"I'm seeing several things: people going out and voting from some of the poorest communities. People enthused. Families just like, 'Yo, I voted. I early voted.' I’m seeing elders and some young people. It just warmed my heart and spirit.\" \"But I also see people who don't feel like they're part of American society and don’t feel like their vote even matters,\" Common says. It's those people — the ones who don't feel politically connected — that he hopes to connect with in the days leading up to the election, he says. \"That’s who we are striving to speak to,\" he says, \"to inspire and say, '[Voting] is how to show you matter. And you care about your block and your community and your hood and your people.' \" RELATED VIDEO: Tiffany Haddish Confirms She’s Dating Common: ‘Best Relationship I've Ever Been in' The struggle, Common says, is getting voters to understand how a trip to the polls can tangibly affect their lives. \"I know it seems so distant, so I try to be as clear as possible,\" he says, offering up a condensed version of a speech he might give to urge someone to vote: \"'You know, these prison laws have been affecting us. This is how you can change that. Long-term sentences for marijuana, too. We know these laws need to be changed, but you've gotta get someone in office who can do it.' \" RELATED:Find Out Which Presidential Candidate These Celebrities Are Supporting Getting out the vote is Common's way of effecting change — but the change he wants to see won't come with a laser-like focus on only the presidential election. \"This election is extremely significant because you have people like Jaimie Harrison, who has potential to win in South Carolina,\" he says. \"That’s a change in things — where you actually can have an agenda and get these laws passed for people. When Obama was in office, he was getting so much resistance from the Senate, he couldn’t get the work done he was striving to. But things are now moving and shifting. The Democrats can have the Senate.\" If the Democrats take the Senate and Biden wins the election, Common is confident that Americans will be in a much better place. \"When Obama was in office, people felt better,\" Common says. \"When you feel better, you think better, you feel more secure.\" As for how he plans to spend election night, he said he'll likely be watching the results from Savannah, Georgia, where he'll soon be in town to begin shooting a new film. \"I'll be probably talking back and forth with my mother and friends,\" he says. \"Watching the results and just sitting there in confidence. Speaking it into existence: 'Change is here. A new administration. The first woman vice president.' And I’m going to be thinking: Now, how are we gonna follow through in this?\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Sessionshas since recused himselffrom any investigations into the president’s campaign, while still maintaining that he’s done nothing wrong. Many have turned to Franken, 65, in the wake of the news for reaction. “I am very troubled that his response to my questioning during his confirmation hearing was, at best, misleading,” hewrote on Facebook last week, adding, “The American people deserve to know the truth about what happened between Russia and the Trump team, and I believe we need thorough and impartial investigations to get to the bottom of it.” Franken, who was in attendanceat the 2017 presidential inauguration, has, at times, injected his signature comedic levity into his disdain for Trump, joking during an appearance onReal Time with Bill Maherlast month about the Republican sentiment about the president’s actions thus far. “Well there’s a range in what they will say,” Franken said. “And some will say that he’s not right mentally, and then some are harsher.

I haven’t heard a lot of good things and I’ve heard some great concern about the president’s temperament.” Just on Sunday, Franken couldn’t hold back his laughter as he addressedTrump’s latest claimsthat President Obama wiretapped the Trump Tower during the 2016 election. “That’s just ridiculous,” hesaid onThis Week, adding, “This is just a distraction, to distract from this very, very serious interference by a foreign power on our democracy and the question of whether Trump world – his campaign, his business associates – had anything to do with it and colluding with them.” Franken further urged from Trump to finally release his tax returns, “if anything,” stating, “We don’t know what the Russians have on Donald Trump.” RELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack The senator’s outspokenness and hard questioning of Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos during the hearings has many feeling that he’ll take the forefront leading up to the 2020 election.Wrote CBS News’ Will Rahnin January, “Franken – no amateur at such things – is better equipped than any Democrat to sink to Mr. Trump’s depths and come up the winner.” As Business Insidernotes, there’s already a grassroots movement started to present Franken as the next Democratic candidate for president.Draft Al Franken 2020says in its site description, “Over the next three years, we hope to convince as many Americans as we can — and even Senator Franken himself — that he is the best choice for president in 2020.” Franken, a Minnesota native and Harvard University alum, wasfirst electedto the Senate in 2008, and then re-elected in 2014. In addition to sitting on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Franken also serves on the Judiciary Committe, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Committee on Indian Affairs. Not unlike the president, Franken has television experience: he was one of the original writers forSaturday Night Livewhen the long-running sketch series debuted in 1975. He stayed with the show – appearing onscreen frequently – until 1980, and returned after a five-year break in 1985. He ultimately left the show in 1995. Despite spending the years that followed working as a political satirist and a progressive Air America Radio host – heeven penned a bookabout his own faux-election as president in 1999 – Franken has worked hard to ditch his comedic persona since taking office (which initially followed an automatic recount and an election contest). He told theNew York Times, “I think the people of Minnesota get that I came here to be their senator and do the work and legislate.” A pre-Election Day pollconducted by Morning Consultfound that Franken had a 60 precent approval rating among his constituents. Announcing his candidacy in 2007after campaigning for fellow Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Franken stated, “Americans have never backed away from challenges. And Minnesotans have always led the way. Our state has sent strong, progressive leaders to Washington—from Hubert Humphrey to Walter Mondale to Paul Wellstone, and now to Amy Klobuchar. Minnesota’s public servants might not always look and sound like typical politicians, but they stand by their principles and lead by their values.” He added, “That’s the kind of leader I think we need more of these days, and that’s the kind of Senator I’ll be.” Still, his comedy background still follows.Asked by CNN’s Jake Tapperlast month if there’s “ever a time where you hear this buzz, and you’re at home, and you look in the mirror and you say to yourself, ‘I’m good enough, I’m smart enough, and doggone it people like me. Maybe I should be president?’ ” Responded Franken, “No.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen other women, all of which he denies. Former PEOPLE reporter Natasha Stoynoff says he forcibly kissed her during a 2005 interview. The Department of Justice is currently fighting in court to represent Trump in a defamation case related to a rape allegation by noted magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump last summer of raping her in a New York City department store dressing room in the 1990s. Dorris was 24 at the time of the alleged encounter, which she toldThe Guardianoccurred on Sept. 5, 1997. The former model was then dating Jason Binn, Trump’s self-described \"best friend,\" who brought her to the event. She toldThe Guardianthat Trump, then 51, had followed her to a bathroom inside his VIP suite and when she came out, he allegedly assaulted her. She said he \"shoved his tongue\" down her throat and groped her while she said she attempted to push him away. “That’s when his grip became tighter and his hands were very gropey and all over my butt, my breasts, my back, everything,” said Dorris, now 48. “I don’t know what you call that when you’re sticking your tongue just down someone’s throat,” Dorris added, “But I pushed it out with my teeth. I was pushing it. And I think I might have hurt his tongue.” The Guardianreported that it corroborated the details of Dorris' allegations with her mother as well as a friend she spoke with immediately following the alleged incident and other friends she told in the years since 1997. PEOPLE also corroborated the details of Dorris' allegation with a close friend who says her story has never changed since sharing it with them more than a decade ago. The White House declined to comment about the allegation on the record. The president’s reelection campaign denied Dorris' story and assailedThe Guardian's reporting. RELATED:The Federal Government Wants to Defend Trump in Rape Accuser Lawsuit — at Taxpayer Expense “The allegations are totally false,” Jenna Ellis, a Trump campaign legal adviser, told PEOPLE in a written statement. “We will consider every legal means available to hold The Guardian accountable for its malicious publication of this unsubstantiated story. This is just another pathetic attempt to attack President Trump right before the election.” Trump was married toMarla Maples, his second wife, at the time. Dorris said the alleged 1997 incident left her in “shock” afterwards. “He came on very strong right away,” Dorris toldThe Guardian. “It seemed typical of a certain guy, people who just feel like they’re entitled to do what they want … even though I was there with my boyfriend.” Dorris said she told Binn to tell Trump to leave her alone afterwards. “I felt violated, obviously,\" she said. \"But I still wasn’t processing it and just was trying to go back to talking to everyone and having a good time because, I don’t know, I felt pressured to be that way.” Dorris toldThe Guardianshe had considered speaking out in 2016 but decided not to because of concern for her twin daughters. “Now I feel like my girls are about to turn 13 years old and I want them to know that you don’t let anybody do anything to you that you don’t want,” she said. “And I’d rather be a role model. I want them to see that I didn’t stay quiet, that I stood up to somebody who did something that was unacceptable.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

In fact, the film and fashion icon estimates she owns between \"400 and 500 swimsuits,\" including a number of vintage designs which inspired her newcapsule collectionfor inclusive swimwear brand,Andie. The debut drop of theDemi Moore x Andieline launches today — featuring 10 brand new swim styles which includeplunging one-pieces,classic bikinis,high-waisted two-piecesandswim skirtsand range in price from $75 to $155 — and marks a close design partnership between the actress and Andie's Vice President of Brand and Design, Michelle Copelman. \"For me, a big part about what was inspiring about this Andie collection was thinking about the things that women feel sensitive about, whether it's their tummy or other areas of the body,\" Moore, 59, tells PEOPLE. \"They don't want to look matronly or not feel sexy or desirable. That was really something in my own mind, which is changing this idea that we become less desirable as we get older.\" RELATED:Demi Moore Shows Off Her Physique in Sexy Bikini Selfies: 'Another Day in Paradise' Copelman tells PEOPLE working with Moore on her first-ever apparel collection was \"exciting\" and a \"learning experience for both of us.\" \"Demi graciously not only opened up her closet, but also her home,\" Copleman tells PEOPLE. \"And in the end, this collection is everything that we were trying to accomplish. The fabrics are a little bit elevated. Some of the swimsuits are lined in the power mesh that's meant to sort of hold a woman in a little bit more and make her feel secure. There is a feminine, sweet, flirty whimsical vibe that carries through throughout the entire collection.\" Moore tells PEOPLE that while designing this line (available in size 0 to 26) she was drawn to vintage swimsuits that felt more like style statements than basic bikinis. \"I started thinking about how the last few years it was about suits with barely any cloth, and how much I loved the kind of elegance and glamor of, in my perception, of some of these vintage suits and the imagery that came with them and how you can feel sexy and empowered and comfortable and not have to show a lot of skin,\" she shares. \"The workmanship that went into the vintage suits is extraordinary. And some of them, you can't actually believe are swimwear. So the idea is: How do we make a woman wear something that feels good and playful and sexy that is also creating security and confidence and still has style? That was our goal.\" RELATED:Demi Moore Says It Was 'Important' to Star Alongside Daughters in New Andie Swimwear Campaign Moore and the Andie team traveled to the French Riviera for the collection's campaign photo shoot, captured by L.A.-based film photographer Drew Escriva in and around Marseilles. \"I probably fit into the category that has not been the most confident about my body. And I think that part of even doing a [swimwear] shoot, no matter what, it is extremely vulnerable,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"I felt so supported and encouraged — even while dealing with my own body dysmorphia. ... I really do hope it makes women feel confident.\" TheDemi Moore x Andie capsulecomes one year after Moore and her three daughters with ex Bruce Willis,Tallulah Willis, 28,Scout Willis, 30, andRumer Willis, 33, partnered with the brand on itsswimwear TOGETHER campaign. At the time, Moore said it was \"important\" for her to share the empowering moment with her daughters. And of course she tapped them for advice when designing this new line. \"They're such inspirations and bring me a different perspective than just my own. Particularly with the bikini bottoms,\" she said. \"I tend to have a preference for a much more '70s cut — I like to wear my bottoms very more low cut, and all of my daughters much prefer a very high cut, '90s. And I wanted to make sure that just because that isn't my preference, that I didn't exclude that. We tried to create a bottom that could be worn both ways.\" The movie star says her girls are also always \"dipping in and out\" of her closet, sharing her love for vintage. \"I saw my youngest daughter [Tallulah] wearing this vintage Japanese kind of silk robe out, of course, doing it as street wear,\" Moore shares. \"And I looked at it and I said, 'Is that from my storage?' And she said, 'Yes, I liberated it. I liberated it from your storage.' \" But she's happy to share: \"At the end it's going to all go to them anyway, so why not let them dip in? And usually what is more of a joy for me is the fact that amongst the thousands of pieces of vintage clothing I have, that I could spot that [robe] probably not having seen it in who knows how long and remember it. That's what's crazy. I know that piece and love seeing it again.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Here's what to know about the whistleblower-turned-Christmas shop owner Linda Tripp Rausch, the Pentagon worker who made tapes ofMonica Lewinskydetailing her relationship with PresidentBill Clinton, died on Wednesdayat age 70. She is survived by husband Dieter Rausch, son Ryan and daughter Allison and her grandchildren — and a legacy that re-shaped American political history. While Linda is best known for her role in the 1998 scandal, she created a new life for herself after she was dismissed from her job as a political appointee in the Pentagon in 2001. PEOPLE confirmed Linda’s death on Wednesday. Joseph Murtha, an attorney who had previously worked with Linda, said, “sadly, Linda did pass away today,” though he could not provide more information. “My mommy is leaving this earth. I don’t know myself if I can survive this heartache,” Linda’s daughter Allison Tripp Foleywrote in a since-deleted Facebook post, per theNew York Post. “Please pray for a painless process for the strongest woman I will ever know in my entire lifetime.” Here’s what to know about Linda’s time in Washington, D.C., and after. Linda secretly recorded conversations with Lewinsky without the former White House intern’s knowledge and went on to share those recordings with independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who was investigating Clinton. That decision thrust her into the spotlight, where she was alternately celebrated and reviled — contending with criticism that she had manipulated the much younger Lewinsky for her own selfish reasons, given her previous work on a Clinton tell-all and ties to the Bush administration. But she insisted she was acting out of moral obligation. “I couldn’t believe — could he [Clinton] be that reckless?” shetold ABC News in 2001. “Could he be that arrogantly reckless to philander with a child? I was reeling from the horror of it all.” RELATED:Linda Tripp Dies at 70: Lightning Rod Exposed Bill Clinton’s Lewinsky Affair — Then Started Over Away from D.C. “I think the country needed to know,” Lindatold Larry King in 2003. “The arrogance — the reckless arrogance that was going on in the Oval Office.” When King pressed her on the secret recordings of someone who considered her a friend, Linda said, “First of all, documenting the evidence was something that happened long after I knew Monica Lewinsky. And after she was informed repeatedly that I would not help President Clinton fix the court case.” Linda has denied that she and Lewinsky were friends, despite the intimate details Lewinsky shared with her and their hours and hours of private conversations. “It wasn’t a friendship,” Linda previously told Fox News. “I wasn’t her mother on any level [but] her mother was absent.” “I wish her well, but I feel sorry for her,” Linda told King in the 2003 interview. When asked if she had anything to add during her testimony in front of a grand jury, Lewinsky said, “I’m really sorry for everything that’s happened.And I hate Linda Tripp,” according to theWashington Post. RELATED:Monica Lewinsky Remembers the ‘Hero’ Who Went to Bat for Me Upon hearing of Linda’s illness on Wednesday, Lewinsky shared well wishes for her former confidante. “no matter the past, upon hearing that linda tripp is very seriously ill,i hope for her recovery,” Lewinsky shared on Twitter Wednesday. “i can’t imagine how difficult this is for her family.” After her dismissal from the Pentagon on the last day of Clinton’s administration, Linda married Dieter Rausch in 2004, and the couple settled in Middleburg, Virginia, which is outside D.C. Linda told Page Six in 2017 that life on her farm there was “paradise with complete autonomy and privacy.” “And that’s how I like it,” she added to the outlet at the time. Linda and her husband also operated a Christmas store called the Christmas Sleigh. Linda divorced her first husband, Bruce Tripp, in 1991. 13 years later, she married Dieter, who she first met as a child while visiting Germany with her family, according to aMiddleburg Lifeprofile. The pair stayed in touch into adulthood, reuniting when Linda invited Dieter to visit her new home in Virginia in 2000. After that visit, Dieter decided to move in with Linda, and the pair were married in 2004.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

His extreme positions on things like book bans and abortions — and a more-than-year-long fight with Walt Disney World — have led some donors and top Republicans todistance themselves from the governor.

The 72-year-old Utah senator surprised many, including those in his own party, when he announced he would vote Trump “guilty” on abuse of power, one of the two impeachment charges Trump faced in his Ukraine scandal. On Thursday’s episode ofThe View, co-host McCain was tempering the praise for Romney from moderatorWhoopi Goldberg, citing what McCain called his history of being a “flip-flopper.” Goldberg, 64, told McCain, 35, she was giving Romney (the 2012 Republican Party presidential nominee) the same cautious support she would have given McCain’s dad, the late Republican Sen.John McCain, who was the party’s presidential nominee before Romney. “With all due respect, Mitt Romney is nothing like my dad,” Meghan immediatelyresponded.

I will always respect it and I think it took big cajones to do that yesterday, but it doesn’t take that much profiles and courage right now to vote against something that is not going to have any impact,” Meghan said, referencing the fact that Trumpwas still acquittedon his impeachment charges. “I just think to Mitt Romney, I want to trust him, but would he still feel this way if Trump had given him his secretary of state position?” Romney and Trump havehad an up-and-down relationship through the yearsbut seemed to patch up their differences when the two met shortly after Trump’s 2016 election win and reportedly discussed the possibility of Romney becoming secretary of state. The position ultimately went to business executive Rex Tillerson. RELATED:Mitt Romney Surprisingly Votes to Convict Donald Trump — The Ups and (Many) Downs of Their Relationship “His history of a flip-flopper, for people like me, I’m never going to trust him,” Meghan said onThe View, adding, “I think right now, the idea that he woke up and found his conscience through the Mormon church is not something that I buy.” Romney had referenced his deep faith as one of the main reasons why he decided to vote to remove President Trump from office. “I am a profoundly religious person,” Romney said in a Senate speech on Wednesday. “I take an oath before God as enormously consequential. I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced. I was not wrong.” The Senate’s Republican majority found Trump not guilty on both of his impeachment charges. Romney became the first senator in American history to vote against his own party’s president in an impeachment trial, earning him praise from liberal voices and placed him firmly in the hot seat among his fellow conservatives. Romney toldThe Atlanticthis week that he planned to not vote for Trump in 2020 and would instead write in his wife’s name — just like he did in 2016. “I get that a lot — ‘Be with the president,’ ” Romney said. “And I’ll say, ‘Regardless of his point of view? Regardless of the issue?’ And they say yes. And … it’s like, ‘Well, no, I can’t do that.’ ”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

It was a gig, he said,that almost didn’t happen at all. “When Lorne called me and asked, ‘Do you want to do this?,’ I said, ‘No, I don’t want to be Trump on TV!’ Because anytime you do any kind of mimicry, it’s of somebody that you appreciate,” Baldwin, who’s hosted the variety program a record 17 times throughout his career, wrote inVanity Fair‘s April issue. “I didn’t hate Trump. I just didn’t want to play him. But Tina [Fey] and Lorne [Michaels] pushed me, so I finally said yes.” In avideo interview with the publication, during which he called Trump “the head writer of [SNL], unintentionally,” Baldwin further explained: “I was supposed to do a film. And the people who were doing the film were supposed to escrow money to guarantee that I would get paid. And they didn’t put the money in escrow. And that’s when I hung up and said I’m not going to go do the movie and I’m going to go do the thing with Lorne. And I think to myself, ‘What if I hadn’t done that?’ … It’s turned out to be this incredible opportunity.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Trump's announcement came the same day leading Democrats in Congress said they sent him a letter requesting just such a move. \"We will soon cross the awful threshold of 100,000 Americans lost to the coronavirus. Flying the flags at half staff ... is an important show of national grief,\" House SpeakerNancy Pelositweeted onThursday night. \"Let us honor their memory & act to save lives.\" In their letter to the president, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerreportedly wrote, \"As we pay our respects to them, sadly, our country mourns the deaths of nearly 100,000 Americans from COVID-19.

He said the flags would be lowered to half-staff — the official phrase many use interchangeably with half-mast — at U.S. government buildings and national monuments from Friday-Sunday \"in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus.\" On Monday, flags would be lowered to honor slain service-members, Trump said. Accordingto aNew York Timestracker, nearly 95,000 people in the U.S. had been killed by the coronavirus pandemic, with daily deaths averaging about 1,500, suggesting the total death toll will cross 100,000 on or around Memorial Day. The Trump administration's coronavirus response has been heavily scrutinized. While he has repeatedly touted his decisions to partially restrict travel from China and Europe as life-saving and said the government's work to increase the ventilator supply did not receive enough attention, detractors have pointed to early issues rolling out nationwide testing and the president's own tone about the virus, which he previously downplayed compared to the seasonal flu. He sometime public differs with his health officials over strategy as well.

That's for an after-action review. But as the president fiddles, people are dying,\" Pelosi, 80,told CNN in late March, in the weeks after the administration's strategy changed course as they promoted national social distancing and other preventative measures. \"It's a vicious, vicious virus,\" Trump, who has attacked Democrats as \"Do Nothings,\"told ABC News earlier this monthwhen asked what he would say to victims' families. \"But I want to just say to the people that have lost family and have lost loved ones, and the people that have just suffered so badly, and just made it — and just made it — that we love you,\" Trump said then.

Video of Floyd's death immediately went viral and led to a wave of protests in Minneapolis, and other American cities, this week. Protests in Minneapolis turned violent Thursday night after the city's largest police precinct was set on fire, forcing police officers to abandon the building while the demonstrations were broadcast on livestreams across social media. Trump called protesters \"THUGS\" in a tweet Thursday night and claimed he told Minnesota Gov. Tim Waltz \"that the Military is with him all the way.\" \"Any difficulty and we will assume control, but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" Trump tweeted. The president's post was soon flagged by Twitter, which attached a label to Trump's tweet that said it \"violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.\" On Friday, Trump tried to walk back his tweet, writing in a follow-up post, \"Looting leads to shooting, and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don’t want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means.\" Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey expressed frustration with Trump's messaging live during a news conference just before 2 am local time, as a reporter read the mayor the president's tweet. “Let me say this: Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else at a time of crisis,” Frey, 38,said. \"Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. This is a difficult time, yes, but you better be damn sure that we’re going to get through this.\" Lightfoot also denounced the president's message with her own stern response during a news conference on Friday. “We see the game he’s playing because it’s so transparent and he’s not very good at it,\" Lightfoot said, according to theChicago Sun-Times. \"He wants to show failures on the part of Democratic local leaders to throw red meat to his base. His goal is to polarize, to destabilize local government and inflame racist urges. And we can absolutely not let him prevail.\" Then Lightfoot, 57, added that she would \"code what I really want to say to Donald Trump,\" before spelling it out for him. RELATED: Minneapolis Mayor Blasts Trump's 'Weakness' After President Criticized 'Total Lack of Leadership' Lightfoot became the Chicago's first black woman ever to be elected mayor after winning a run-off election against longtime city official Toni Preckwinkle last April. Lightfoot, who had never held an elected office before becoming Chicago's top official, also became the city's first openly gay mayor. A former prosecutor and the one-time head of the Chicago Police Board, Mayor Lightfoot was also the lead on a 2016 city task force that determined racism was a major contributing factor in a number of Chicago Police Department failures and a leading cause for the public's mistrust in the police department. Those same issues are now playing out this week in Minneapolis in response to Floyd's death — as they have in in Chicago afterLaquan McDonald's, in New York City followingEric Garner's, in Texas afterSandra Bland's, in Florida afterTrayvon Martin'sand countless other cases that protesters argue are deadly examples of a racist abuse of power that's plagued police forces across the country for decades. The2016 review of the Chicago Police Department, which Lightfoot led, found that “C.P.D.’s own data gives validity to the widely held belief the police have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.\" RELATED: Taylor Swift Slams Donald Trump for 'Threatening Violence' in Response to George Floyd Protests While critics like Lightfoot see Trump's social media activity as an attempt to fan social divides, the most prominent liberal leaders in the country have previously called on Democrats to take the higher ground when it comes to the outspoken president. \"When they go low, we go high,\" former First Lady Michelle Obama famously said at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, about four months before Trump was elected president. But Lightfoot was asked Friday about the former first lady's 2016 quote and made it clear she's done taking the \"high\" road when it comes to Trump, alleging that he's \"using his bully pulpit to foment violence.\" “I am not Michelle Obama,” Lightfoot said, according to theSun-Times. “I will not remain silent while this man cynically tries to turn this incredibly painful moment into one for his own political gain.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Her predecessor, Newt Gingrich, made the trip in 1997. In a statement issued shortly after she touched down in the region, Pelosi said the trip \"honors America's unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan's vibrant Democracy.\" RELATED:Why the Pentagon Fears for Nancy Pelosi's Safety If She Visits Taiwan, as China Promises Strong Response \"Our discussions with Taiwan leadership will focus on reaffirming our support for our partner and on promoting our shared interests, including advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region,\" she continued. \"America's solidarity with the 23 million people of Taiwan is more important today than ever, as the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy.\" Pelosi was supposed to lead a congressional delegation to Taiwan in April but postponed aftertesting positive for COVID-19. The trip comes in spite of warnings from Chinese officials, including Foreign Ministry spokespersonZhao Lijiang, who said last Wednesday: \"We have repeatedly made clear our firm opposition to Speaker Pelosi's potential visit to Taiwan. If the U.S. side insists on making the visit and challenges China's red line, it will be met with resolute countermeasures. The U.S. must assume full responsibility for any serious consequence arising thereof.\" China's Ministry of National Defense has echoed that rhetoric, also saying last week that Pelosi should cancel the trip or the country's military will \"resolutely defend national sovereignty.\" The Wall Street Journalreportsthat Chinese leader Xi Jinping warned PresidentJoe Bidenin a phone call last week of countermeasures if Pelosi's trip were to proceed.

On Thursday, the 44th president announced that the Obama Presidential Center's water garden, which will be located near the center's north entrance garden, will be named after his mother. The water garden \"will serve as a designated place on campus meant for reflection and relaxation\" and feature an art installation from Maya Lin — the artist who created the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. — called \"Seeing Through the Universe,\" which promises to feature an oculus that creates mist and a flat \"pebble\" piece that will fill with water. For more on Barack Obama, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day. \"When we thought about what may be a fitting way to commemorate my mother's influence on my sister and me, I thought about where she would want to be in this space,\" Obama said in a release. \"I could picture her sitting on one of the benches on a nice summer afternoon, smiling and watching a bunch of kids running through the fountain, and I thought that would capture who she was as well as just about anything else.\" Lin, 62, also created the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama, and is one of Obama's personal favorite artists, according to Obama's team. In 2016, Obamaawarded Lin with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, during his final months in the White House. The Ann Dunham Water Garden, as the installation will be known, is funded by contributions from the Obama administration and alumni from the former president's two presidential campaigns, according to the release. \"It means so much to us that this gesture comes from the team who helped President Obama reach the White House and serve the American people,\" Obama Foundation CEO Valerie Jarrett said in a statement. \"President Obama's mother was an inspiration to him, exemplifying passion, curiosity, and a commitment to service,\" the statement continued. \"Our hope is that the Ann Dunham Water Garden and the Obama Presidential Center inspire the same qualities within our visitors.\" \"Ann Dunham was the biggest influence on President Obama's life,\" reads apost on the Obama Foundation's websitefrom Jarrett Thursday. \"She believed strongly in the power of human connection and the inherent dignity in all of us, values she instilled in her children. Decades later, a commitment to those same values would inspire millions of Americans to join a movement that carried President Obama to the White House. Construction on the Obama Presidential Center broke ground in September 2021 and expects to welcome more than 700,000 visitors to Chicago's South Side, where Obama grew up, annually once it opens in 2025.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: On June 26, 2016, just before midnight, Bev Bailey-Potter got the call that every parent fears the most: Her 24-year-old son Cameron “Cam” Underwood — a welder and machinist from Northern California — was in the hospital fighting for his life. Earlier that evening Cam, who’d battled depression since his teen years, had attempted suicide by shooting himself in the face. “The doctor said, ‘Your son’s face is dust.’ We went into the emergency room and saw him. I was just in shock,” recalls Bev, 56. “The bottom of his face was covered up; he had his eyes, his forehead. We were told that he would not survive.” Miraculously Cam did survive — but his injuries left the once-active outdoorsman reliant on a feeding tube and barely able to speak. Afterreading a story in a December 2016 issue ofPeopleabout a groundbreakingface transplant program at NYU Langone Medical Centerin New York City, she booked an appointment with the program’s director, Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez. Thirteen months after that, doctors found a perfect match in 23-year-old Will Fisher, a budding New York City writer and filmmaker who died suddenly on Jan. 5, 2018, after battling mental illness on and off for several years. That same day Cam became the recipient of a successful face transplant. Says Bev: “He had a beautiful smile — and now he’s got a beautiful smile again.” The youngest son of pastor Randy Underwood, 63, and Bev, who was a legal assistant and paralegal (they divorced in 2008), Cam grew up in Yuba City, Calif., where he shared an active lifestyle — hunting, fishing and snowboarding — with his siblings Julie, 40, Aaron, 36, and Brad, 28. But underneath the happy exterior Cam grappled silently with depression, and by the time he was 23 he was relying on alcohol to self-medicate and bury his darker emotions. “I saw that he was struggling, he was unhappy,” says Bev. “But I never thought he would harm himself.” On that tragic night in June, after a day of drinking, Cam placed a gun under his chin and pulled the trigger. He was airlifted from a local hospital to the UC Davis Medical Center, where he was initially put in a medically induced coma and then kept heavily sedated for the next five weeks. RELATED:Face Transplant Recipient Patrick Hardison Gets Kiss from His Donor’s Mother in Tear-Filled First Meeting: ‘It’s Like She’s Family’ “When I woke up, I didn’t know what was going on, where I was, what had happened to me,” says Cam, who learned that he was missing most of his face below his eyes, including his nose, jaw and teeth. His tongue remained, and his eyes were intact, but the sockets were badly damaged. “I was shocked that I would actually do something like that, and that I had survived.” Adds Bev: “We kept the mirrors covered in the hospital, until he was ready to see himself.” Adjusting to his disfigurement wasn’t easy. “Communicating was a big problem. I had to write notes. Just eating was a big mess—for as much food as I got into my mouth, just as much didn’t go in,” says Cam, now 26, who covered his injury with a bandanna or a mask whenever he was out in public. “It was a tough time.” During his five-month stay in the hospital, Cam underwent three skin grafts in the hope of rebuilding his face enough so he could become a candidate for a face transplant. But by the time Cam was discharged on Dec. 2, 2016, they were still waiting for references, and no progress had been made toward starting the process. Fortunately it was just a few weeks later when Bev, during the family’s annual holiday trip to Lake Tahoe, bought the copy ofPeopleat the grocery store — and read the story aboutNYU Langone’s face transplant program. “Kate Middleton was on the cover — that’s probably why I bought it,” says Bev. “When I read that article, I thought, ‘I’ve got to do something.’ ” RELATED:How The First Extensive Face Transplant Helped a Burn Victim Reclaim His Life: ‘Now I’m Just a Normal Guy — There’s No Staring’ Cam and his mom met with Dr. Rodriguez March 15, 2017, and he agreed to take on Cam as a patient. And 18 months after that devastating night Cam finally received the call from Dr. Rodriguez, notifying him that a New York-based organ donation agency calledLiveOnNYhad found a match in Fisher — and he and Bev flew to New York. The surgery was risky, but Cam was determined to change his life: “It was either stay the way I was or take a chance on something better — on a bigger, better life.” During the 25-hour surgery a team led by Dr. Rodriguez attached the lower part of Will’s face (including the jaw, teeth, nose, cheeks and lower eyelids) to Cam’s disfigured visage. “Many people ask, ‘Why would we put so much energy and resources into someone who wanted to eliminate their life?’ ” he says. “But I’ve never felt that should exclude anybody from getting state-of-the-art medical care. Cam was a good candidate for this type of operation because he was willing to put that [difficult] part of his life behind him and move forward. And this was the only type of operation that was going to get his life back on track.” And the operation did just that. When Cam looked in the mirror for the first time after the surgery, a month later, “I remember just a sigh of relief that I had a face again, I had a mouth and teeth again, I had a nose again—just such amazement and joy,” he says “I couldn’t be more thankful for all the hard work and the sacrifices that were made for me.” In the 10 months since the surgery, Cam has shown no signs of rejecting his new face. He’s able to eat, speak and grow facial hair—and he’s back to playing basketball and golfing weekly; he even went skydiving last May. (“Why not?!” he says.) “The biggest difference,” says Cam, “is just being able to go out without a mask and without people staring at me.” Today, Cam — who manages his depression through therapy and medication — is moving forward. “I just want to get back to work and eventually start a family,” he says. Adds Bev: “I got my son back. And I feel so blessed that he can now live a normal life.” Now,LiveOnNYPresident and CEO Helen Irving believes Cam’s story will spread the word and encourage others to become organ donors. “It is my hope that William and Sally’s selflessness and courage will inspire others to consider registering as lifesaving organ and tissue donors,” Irving says. “It is a true story of unconditional love and a deep compassion to help another find a new life. … Nearly 115,000 people in the U.S. [are] waiting for an organ. However, this story shows that the future is bright and that transplantation is breaking new barriers. Lives are renewed. And it demonstrates that while the science evolves, the willingness of Americans to help others remains strong.” On Oct. 17 Cam and his mom were able to thank the woman who changed their lives: his donor Will’s mother, Sally Fisher. (Her son’s heart, liver, kidneys and eyes were also donated to other recipients.) “I’m just eternally grateful,” says Bev. “From one mom to another, I feel this bond with her that I will carry forever because of the gift she gave my son.” The transplant is also helping mend the heartbreak Sally has felt since losing her own son. “He was extremely compassionate and wise for his age,” Sally says of Will, an accomplished chess player who studied at Johns Hopkins University. “He was the smartest person I know. That’s not just a proud mother talking, he was brilliant.” “That’s the hardest thing about losing Will was realizing how much he had to give, and he didn’t get the chance to have that life. He had an amazing mind and I feel like it was a loss, not only for his family and his friends but for the world,” Sally adds. And as she grieves her loss, Sally sees hope in Cam. “I don’t think I would have survived Will’s death if it wasn’t for Cameron,” she says. ““Cameron’s got his whole life ahead of him — and I love the idea that Willie’s helping him have a better life.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The outlook is somewhat bleak for Republicans, with even the presidentrecently admittingto donors that keeping the Senate will be \"very tough.\" Here is a look at a handful of races that could determine which party will control the chamber in 2021. RELATED: Donald Trump Denies He Called Late John McCain and Fallen U.S. Soldiers 'Losers' Alabama was won byDonald Trumpby nearly 30 points in 2016, making Democrat Doug Jones’ 2017 election something of an anomaly in the very red state. Jones, 66, won a special election after Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions left office to work as Trump’s attorney general. Sessions returned to his home state after being forced to resign by Trump and made another go for his Senate seat. He ultimately lost the primary to fellow Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former Alabama University football coach who’s molded himself in the image of Trump since launching his bid for Senate. Tuberville's lack of political experience (which even his former players havecriticized) andrefusal to debateJones haven't hurt his chances. In the week leading up to the election, Tuberville, 66, held adouble-digit leadover Jones — a sign that the seat is unlikely to flip, though it's worth noting that Jones hasout-raisedTuberville by a significant margin. In the few days before the election, Jonescontinued to campaignin the hopes that he could get his numbers up. Tuberville, meanwhile, said he planned to get a hair cut andgo golfing. Though his re-election chances are grim, Jones' race is one to watch, if only for the simple fact that he's unlikely to fade from the political landscape. Some analysts have speculated that if he loses, the former prosecutor isrumoredto be among a Biden administration's top choices for attorney general. Just two years ago, Arizona was represented in the Senate by two Republicans. In 2018, that changed when former Air Force colonel Martha McSally lost a Senate race to Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema. McSally, 54, still managed to secure an Arizona Senate seat, however, after Republican Gov. Doug Duceyappointed her to the seatopened up in the wake of Sen. John Kyl's resignation. Astrained relationshipwith Trump — whom the Republican Senator has tried to ingratiate herself with in recent months — has plagued McSally in the two years since, and she now faces an uphill battle in holding on to her seat. Shifting demographics in Arizona have helped Democrat Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut married to shooting survivor Gabbie Giffords, open up a lead in the polls against his opponent. Kelly, 56, has run a campaign that promises science- and evidence-based policy, a theme that so far appears to be resonating with voters. If elected, he would be the the first astronaut on Capitol Hill in roughly 40 years. Former two-term Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper looks to seize on left-leaning trends in Colorado, where incumbent Republican Sen. Cory Gardner aims to reclaim his seat. A stream ofpollsshow Gardner, 46, heading for a loss, however — a downward trend that’s led Republican groups to decrease their spending in Colorado, fearing a blowout. According to theColorado Sun, more than a quarter million voters have switched political parties in Colorado in the past six years. And with more than half a million new voter registrations, Gardner has his work cut out for him. Though Gardner has aimed to appeal to both liberals and conservatives, campaigning as a \"new kind of Republican,\" he's also made appearances atcampaign ralliesfor Trump — a move that could backfire in the end. Since taking office, Trump’s job approval rating in Colorado has faltered and Hickenlooper, 68, has benefited fromvoters' resistanceto the president. Georgia has been a historically reliable state for Republicans, with Democrats not winning a Senate race in the Peach State since 2000 (the state hasn't elected aDemocratic presidentsince 1992). Still, it's become more competitive, with liberal candidates now aiming to unseat two Republican incumbents: David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler. Democrat Jon Ossoff first burst onto the Georgia politics scene in 2017, when he ran in a special election for Georgia's 6th congressional district. Though he ultimately lost the race, Ossoff, 33, cemented his standing in the state's political scene andbroke national fundraising recordsfor a U.S. House candidate. Nearly two years later, Ossoff waded back into campaign waters, aiming to unseat Perdue, 70. In the weeks leading up to Nov. 3, Ossoff out-raised Perdue by millions, with much of his fundraising spurred by Perdue's own behavior. In late July, Perduereleased an adin which Ossoff, who is Jewish, appeared to have an enlarged nose — a marketing tactic widely viewed as anti-Semitic, though Perdue’s campaign denied that it had made any alterations and then blamed the ad on anoutside vendor. Perdue's blunders continued in the weeks leading up to the election. In October, he faced nationwide backlash aftermockingvice presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ name at a Trump rally in Macon. Ossoff, meanwhile, raised nearly $2 million in the two days following the event. A statewide poll conducted days before the election showed the twodeadlocked. Georgia's other Senate seat is unlike any other in the country, in that it involves three candidates, two of whom are seemingly trying toout-Republicanone another. When Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson announced his retirement from the Senate in 2019, Sen. Kelly Loeffler was appointed as his successor. She now faces fellow Republican Doug Collins (currently a member of the House of Representatives) and Democratic pastor Raphael Warnock, who has a slight lead in polls. Over the past year, Loeffler, 49, has made a name for herself due tosuspicious stock tradesmade before the COVID-19 pandemic bean ravaging the market and a continual move to the right, one that puts hersquarely in lockstepwith President Trump. It's unlikely that any of the three candidates will receive more than 50 percent of the vote (the threshold required to win), meaning a federal runoff election, set for January, is likely. Iowa, a state that is almost always at the center of the political universe, finds itself in the midst of an increasingly hard-fought Senate race, one recently found to be thesecond most expensivein U.S. history. Republican incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst’s fate seems increasingly tied to Trump’s. Though he won the state by a wide margin in 2016, Iowans have harshly assessed his pandemic response — and, by extension, Ernst’s, 50. Ernst’s political evolution is notable. In 2014, she strode on to the political scene with a promise to “unload” (quite, literally, in an ad that showed her visiting a shooting range) on Obamacare. Now in the middle of a pandemic, Ernst’s message centers on preserving parts of the Affordable Care Act that would guarantee coverage for those with preexisting conditions. She faces Democrat Theresa Greenfield, a moderate who Ernst and other Republicans have attempted tocastas a progressive radical. A recent poll fromThe New York Timesand Siena College found the two ina statistical tie. Republican incumbent Susan Collins has historically cruised to re-election, but her fractured relationship with President Trump (not to mention Democrats) makes her road ahead a lot bumpier in 2020. She faces a formidable opponent in Sara Gideon, the Democrat house speaker of Maine. Polls show a narrow edge for Gideon, 48, who is campaigning on a platform of preserving health care coverage. Over her four terms in Congress, Collins, 67, has attempted to craft an image of bipartisanship, but has alsomanaged to alienateboth Republicans and Democrats along the way. She's attempted to stay out of presidential politics in recent weeks and haspublicly opposed the presidentin the past. Still, Trump's lack of popularity among voters could harm many Republicans — even those, like Collins, who have tried to distance themselves from the president.Late pollsshowed Biden leading Trump statewide in Maine, while Gideon held a slim lead over Collins. RELATED: Sex Assault Survivors Who Begged Susan Collins to Vote No on Kavanaugh SayThey Feel 'Betrayed' Though Republican Steven Daines is the incumbent in Montana's Senate race, Democrat Steve Bullock has slightly higher popularity and name recognition in the state, where he previously served as governor. While the state itself is independent, it did go for Trump in 2016. The president’sapproval ratinghas slipped in Montana over the last four years, though, meaning Daines, 58, could have his work cut out for him. Polls show Daines and Bullock, 54, in a statistical dead heat, indicating that the high-stakes battle could be one determined by a few thousand of votes. Republican incumbent Thom Tillis has tied himself closely to Trump when it comes to issues of immigration and taxes. The 60-year-old senator hopes that relationship will help his win re-election in a state Trump carried by more than three percentage points in 2016. Democrat Cal Cunningham, a former state senator, seemed to face an even tougher battle, though, when ensnared in an October surprise. Cunningham, 47, admitted to having an extramarital relationship aftertext messageshe sent to a woman that is not his wife surfaced in the media. The full impact of the scandal remains to be seen, with Tillis and Cunninghampolling neck-and-neckin the final days of their campaigns.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

But as a legislator representing Queens, in New York City, she learned there are plenty of women in her own district whocan’t afford pads and tampons. “It isn’t just girls in underdeveloped countries who have to skip school for a week out of every month because they couldn’t afford these kinds of products,” Meng, a member of the House of Representatives, tells PEOPLE. “These stories are in our country, a developed country, where there shouldn’t be these kinds of things taking place.” Meng hopes to change that with theMenstrual Equity for All Act of 2017 (H.R. 972), introduced Feb. 13, which would providegreater access to free or reduced-cost menstrual productsfor women nationwide. “This is a real issue that prevents more than half the population in some parts of the world and our country from getting an education, and causes shame just for being born a woman. I think it’s time that we educate ourselves and make sure we’re doing our part,” she says. Meng, who is in her third term in Congress, worked on several bills in New York City and stateto provide free menstrual productsto schools, jails and homeless shelters, along witheliminating the sales taxon these products. “We’ve heard stories about girls in New York City who are too embarrassed or couldn’t afford these products. Some of them have used a rag; some would just skip school for a few days. And that’s just heartbreaking for me,” she says. “Whether it’s young girls we heard about in our own city, to hearing stories about women in homeless shelters or prisons where they can’t afford their own products, and it really compelled me to work on this issue. I felt like there wasn’t enough attention drawn on it nationwide, and I just wanted to do my part.” RELATED VIDEO: What You Need to Know: The Tampon Tax One way she hopes to reduce costs on menstrual products is through theFlexible Spending Account, which allows people to get basic healthcare products tax-free. But while many unisex products are available through the program,tampons and pads aren’t included, which Meng chalks up to thesocial stigma around periods. “I think the issue makes people — both men and women — a little uncomfortable,” she says. “I had to testify about this issue in our Congressional Ways and Means Commission, in front of a bunch of men, and I could tell that people felt uncomfortable. We’ve grown up in a society where it’s taboo.” RELATED VIDEO: #PeriodsAreNotAnInsult: Women Are Tweeting Donald Trump about Their Periods Meng understands that the bill may not pass — her goal is simply to make people aware of the issue. “I just want people to start realizing that this is a problem, and to start having these conversations,” she says. “We talk about really basic things, like the Flexible Spending Account, which covers bandages, and crutches, and fake teeth. And I’m not knocking those, but menstrual hygiene products are definitely as much of a necessity as those products.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: As election results continue to roll in from this month’s midterms,Donald Trumpis making wild new — and wholly unsubstantiated — allegations about voter fraud, including suggesting that voters cast multiple ballots by simply returning to polling places over and over again in new outfits. “The Republicans don’t win and that’s because of potentially illegal votes,” the president claimed during an interview with the Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion website, on Wednesday. “When people get in line that have absolutely no right to vote and they go around in circles. Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It’s really a disgrace what’s going on.” Additionally, Trump called for national voter ID laws. “If you buy a box of cereal — you have a voter ID,” Trump said. “They try to shame everybody by calling them racist, or calling them something, anything they can think of, when you say you want voter ID. But voter ID is a very important thing.” Trump provided no evidence to his claims, nor did the White House immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment. As outlets likeThe Washington Postand others have reported, there isno evidence of widespread voter fraudin the United States. Trump’s own special commission to study voter fraud in the 2016 election was disbanded without finding any evidence, after some states refused to provide data. The Daily Caller also asked the president about Brenda Snipes, the election supervisor from Florida’s Broward County. Many counties in Florida, including Broward and Palm Beach counties, are still tallying votes in Florida’s senate and gubernatorial race after a recount mandated by state law was called. According to the AP,unexpectedly high voter turnout and the length of this year’s ballotshave caused the slow recount in Broward — though Republicans have accused Snipes of fraud. “She should have been removed,” Trump told The Daily Caller of Snipes. “I think she should have been removed in the middle of this mix-up.” “She’s a disaster,” Trump added. “You look at her past, she’s a disaster. Even with me. I won Florida and — you remember? That area, Broward, didn’t come in.

On Tuesday, celebrities, includingCardi B,Kerry Washington,Mariah CareyandMickey Guyton, among dozens of stars and lawmakers, shared their reactions after jurors foundDerek Chauvinguilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter in the killing ofGeorge Floydlast May. The verdict comes nearly a year after Floyd, 46, a Black man who was in police custody in Minneapolis for allegedly spending a counterfeit $20 bill, died facedown on the ground with his hands cuffed behind him as Chauvin, a white officer, pinned his knee to Floyd's neck for about nine minutes. Floyd's murder spawned protests and riots across the country last summer and sparked a reckoning about police brutality and racism in the United States. \"A guilty #verdict. But this fight for justice is not over. We have a lot of work to do,\" wroteWashingtonon Twitter. \"There is more fight ahead of us. But RIGHT NOW please take CARE of yourself. And let's take care of each other.

He's gone. His family will never be made whole,\" wrote actressYvette-Nicole Brown. \"And how many #DerekChauvin's [sic] are there in the world & on the police force. There's more than ONE bad apple. But this enough for this moment. ❤️\" RELATED:George Floyd's Brother 'Feeling Tears of Joy' After Derek Chauvin Is Convicted of Murder U.S. lawmakers, including former PresidentBarack Obama, also reacted to the verdict. \"Today, a jury in Minneapolis did the right thing,\" Obama wrote. \"For almost a year, George Floyd's death under the knee of a police officer has reverberated around the world — inspiring murals and marches, sparking conversations in living rooms and new legislation.

But if we're being honest with ourselves, we know that true justice is about much more than a single verdict in a single trial,\" he continued, adding that the verdict today is a \"necessary step\" toward progress. He also shared prayers to Floyd's family. \"Today's verdict is an important step forward for justice in Minnesota. The trial is over, but our work has only begun,\" wrote Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan. \"True justice for George only comes through real, systemic change to prevent this from happening again. And the tragic death of Daunte Wright this week serves as a heartbreaking reminder that we still have so much more work to do to get there. Too many Black people have lost — and continue to lose—their lives at the hands of law enforcement in our state. … We must rebuild, restore, and reimagine the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\" Senators from MinnesotaAmy Klobucharand Tina Smith echoed those sentiments in statements. \"Today's conviction was right. For the Floyd family, nothing will bring back George, but this verdict is a first step towards accountability,\" wrote Klobuchar. \"This trial was about George Floyd's murder, but it also captured his life. … George Floyd should be alive today, and this conviction will not bring him back to us, nor will it bring us total justice. … And while Black Americans continue to be subjected to a system that keeps mothers and fathers up at night worrying about whether their children are going to come back home every time they get in a car, we know our work is not done. \" RELATED:Derek Chauvin Convicted of All Charges in Murder of George Floyd \"Convicting Dereck Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd is a moment of accountability, and also a moment to recommit ourselves to the movement for racial justice his tragic murder sparked,\" added Smith. \"What if this verdict is the beginning of a transformation in public safety for Minnesota and our country, where we move past the warrior model of policing and toward a model of truly protecting and serving? What if we rethink public safety so that Black and Brown people, and all people, truly feel safe and protected in their homes, neighborhoods and communities? This is the work ahead of all of us.\" Other celebrities echoed their relief at the verdict and called for further justice. \"rest in JUSTICE George Floyd,\" tweetedKaty Perry. \"A moment of accountability 🙏🏼Finally #GeorgeFloyd,\" wroteHayley Kiyoko. \"I could never possibly understand what it's like to be discriminated against due to the color of my skin but today all of my heart goes out to the black community. justice was achieved,\" tweetedYungblud. \"George Floyd should have never had his life taken so hatefully but let today be a day of progress for future generations to see.\" Chauvin was taken away in handcuffs and will go directly to jail. He will be sentenced in eight weeks. Second-degree murder carries a sentence of up to 40 years in prison, while the penalty for third-degree murder is up to 25 years. Manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 10 years. The presiding judge, Peter A. Cahill, has wide discretion in how he imposes the sentences. It's unclear whether the sentences will be imposed consecutively or concurrently — or whether Chauvin's status as a first-time offender will result in a shorter sentence. According to theNew York Times, the recommended sentence in for a first-time offender found guilty of second- or third-degree murder is 12 1/2 years in Minnesota.

In years past, he’sconsidered runsfor both the senate and governor, but ultimately decided not to run, according to theChicago Tribune. In 2009, he said he decided against running because he felt he could do more at home in Illinois than in Washington — and used his aunt, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founder of the Special Olympics, as an example of someone who made a difference outside of politics. “In the end, I did not want to have to leave the state in order to serve it,” Kennedy said, according totheTribune. “They say love conquers all, and in my case, it conquered ambition. I realize that I would rather be a good husband and a good father than a good Washington politician.” “I have also given great consideration to other examples in my family, including that of my Aunt Eunice, who was able to accomplish enormous goals, affecting millions of people without going into politics,” he wrote. This time around, if he’s the Democrats’ choice, he’ll be up against incumbent Governor Bruce Rauner.

During her trial, a former housekeeper testified that Helmsley had once told her, “We don’t pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.” In 1989, Helmsley was convicted on a host of tax offenses. She served 18 months in prison after the judge ordered her sentence to start on April 15 – Tax Day. In the late 1980s, televangelist Jim Bakker was on top of the world. He and his wife, Tammy Faye, presided over an empire including a television show that brought in $128 million annually and a religious theme park that was America’s third-most popular attraction. But Jim fell from grace when he was found to have skimmed millions from his ministry to pay for his lavish lifestyle, which included his-and-hers Rolls Royces. Among the revelations was that Bakker used church funds to buy the silence of Jessica Hahn, a former church secretary who alleged Bakker raped her. Baker served five years in prison on fraud and conspiracy convictions. Now 75, he hosts a television show focusing on what he believes is the impending apocalypse, and sells survival gear. In 1989, wealthy brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were accused of the grisly shooting deaths of their parents, entertainment executive Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty. During their trial, the brothers – then 21 and 19 – rejected the claim that they had killed their parents to get their hands on their multimillion-dollar estate. Instead, they claimed that they had killed their parents after years of suffering unspeakable sexual and psychological abuse. Despite the headline-grabbing defense, the jurors rejected the brothers' allegations and convicted them of murder. They were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Christian Brando was the eldest son of Marlon Brando’s 11 biological and adopted children. In 1990, Christian’s sister, Cheyenne, told him that her boyfriend and father of her unborn child, Dag Drollet, physically abused her, though the claims were never verified. Christian fatally shot Drollet in Brando’s posh, Mulholland Drive mansion. He pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and served six years in prison. When he got out, he couldn’t escape negative attention: After Robert Blake’s wife, Bonnie Lee Bakely, was murdered in 2001, Blake blamed Christian, alleging he had his friend murder Bakely. Christian was never charged. Blake was tried for the crime and acquitted, he was found liable for Bakely’s death in a civil trial. Cheyenne Brando committed suicide in 1995. Christian Brando died in 2008 of pneumonia at 49. Twelve-year-old Polly Klaas was hosting a slumber party at her mother’s home in Petaluma, California, on Oct. 1, 1993, when a man entered her bedroom, tied up her two friends and covered their heads with pillowcases before kidnapping Polly at knifepoint. Her body was found two months later when Richard Allen Davis, the man who entered her bedroom that night, led investigators to the shallow grave in Clovedale, California, where he buried her. A career criminal, Davis admitted to strangling Klaas. He was convicted of her murder in 1996 and sentenced to death. His criminal record helped pass California's \"Three Strikes Law\" for repeat offenders. He is currently on death row in California’s San Quentin State Prison. For several weeks in 1994, the sports world turned its attention to a tawdry spectacle when superstar figure skater Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee by a baton-wielding assailant. The assailant, America learned, was hired by the husband of Kerrigan’s rival, Tonya Harding. It became known as “The Whack Heard ‘Round the World.” Kerrigan recovered in time to win the Silver Medal in the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics. But Harding, besieged by controversy, faired poorly at the Olympics because of a broken lace. She was later stripped of the National Championship she had won two days afer the attack on Kerrigan. Hardingpleaded guiltyto hindering prosecution and was banned from amateur skating. Kerrigan refuses to speak to Harding to this day. Before his ex-wife’s killing in 1994, NFL legend O.J. Simpson was known not only for his prowess on the football field but also for his affable nature as an actor and celebrity. But shortly after he was accused of murdering Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, waiter Ronald Goldman, details about rage-filled fights with his ex-wife that were fueled by jealousy began to emerge. “I don't know who the guy is,” Simpson's longtime acquaintance, onetime National Football League superstar Jim Brown, said at the time. In 1995, after the “Trial of the Century,” Simpson was famously acquitted of double murder. But after a conviction for a 2007 armed robbery and kidnapping in Las Vegas, Simpson is now serving a 33-year-sentence, though he is eligible for parole in July. Jeffrey Dahmer’s crimes were among the most chilling in American history: Between 1978 and 1991, the Wisconsin man killed 17 men and boys. He had sex with corpses and ate some of his victims. When Dahmer was arrested in 1991, police found body parts and severed heads in his fridge, freezer and a filing cabinet. He confessed to his crimes and was sentenced to 15 consecutive life terms in jail and was killed by a fellow inmate in 1994. Six-year-old beauty queenJonBenét Ramseywas found dead in the basement of her family's home in Boulder, Colorado. She had been strangled with a sophisticated garrote and suffered blunt force trauma to her head. A ransom note was found near her body. The high-profile investigation became one of the costliest in Colorado history, but authorities were never able to determine who had killed the girl. The DNA of an unknown male was found at the scene, and handwriting experts were unable to definitively tie the ransom note to the family. While the girl's parents, Patsy and John Ramsey, were originally considered suspects, they were formally cleared of suspicion in 2008. The crime remains unsolved. On February 9, 1997, 8-month-old Matthew Eappen fell into a coma and died of a fractured skull in his home in Newton, Massachusetts. Authorities arrested Louise Woodward, a 19-year-old British au pair, and charged her with the boy's death. After a highly-publicized trial, a jury convicted Woodward of second-degree murder. She was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. Ten days after the verdict, the judge reduced her charge to involuntary manslaughter and her sentence was reduced to the time she had already served, 279 days. Matthew's parents denounced the verdict and filed a civil lawsuit to prevent Woodward from profiting from the crime. She returned to the U.K. and resumed a quiet life. On May 28, 1998, comedian Phil Hartmanwas fatally shot in his sleep by his wife, Brynn, who then turned the gun on herself in a bedroom of their $1.4 million Encino house. In the weeks following the highly publicized murder-suicide, details emerged about Brynn, who was plagued by substance abuse problems and given to fits of rage and was far more troubled than anyone realized. A recovering alcoholic and cocaine user, Brynn had recently started drinking again after a decade of near-sobriety. While outwardly the couple seemed to have it all, \"this was not a happy household,\" said a TV producer who knew them. BarettaalumRobert Blakewas acquitted of murder charges in the death of his wifeBonnie Bakley, in a high-profile case and 2005 trial that commentators compared to the O.J. Simpson proceedings 10 years earlier. Bakley, a 44-year-old mother of four, was fatally shot in Blake’s car in 2001 after the couple dined at an Italian restaurant in California. A jury found the now-83-year-old actornot guilty of the murderafter officials called into question the credibility of multiple prosecution witnesses and Los Angeles Police Department investigators. However, Blake wasordered to pay $ 15 millionby a civil jury, which found him responsible for Bakley’s death. The King of Pop had been accused in 1993 of molesting a boy at his Neverland ranch, resulting in a settlement of a reported $15 to $20 million that prevented the boy from speaking about the claims. In late 2003, Jackson was accused of molesting a 12-year-old cancer survivor who had been a visitor to Neverland who alleged he was plied with wine and abused. In 2005, Jackson went on trial on a slew of charges including child sexual abuse and giving intoxicating substances to a minor. He was acquitted of all charges, but the acquittal didn’t erase suspicions about Jackson. Months before the 2003 accusations, Jackson had said in a British documentary that he slept in his bed with “many children. I slept in the bed with all of them,” describing the practice as “the most loving thing.” In one of the country’s most sensational murder cases, Scott Peterson stood trial for killing his eight-months pregnant wife, Laci Peterson, who disappeared in California on December 24, 2002. Four months later, her body and the body of their unborn son, Conner, washed ashore near a Berkeley marina. The investigation and ensuing trial revealed Peterson’s web of lies, including where he was when Laci vanished. He was convicted of first-degree murder in Laci’s death and second-degree murder for the death of their unborn baby. He sits on death row in California's San Quentin State Prison. Mary Winkler, a soft-spoken preacher's wife, was convicted of manslaughter after killing her husband Matt, a Tennessee minister who was found shot to death in the couple's home in 2006. She spent five months in jail as she awaited trial followed by a little more than two months at a mental health facility. In the wake of the crime, one question remained on everyone's mind: Why did she kill her husband? Winkler's lawyer, Steven Farese, said then that the couple's public and private lives didn't \"always run parallel.\" And Winkler later said that she killed her husband after years of abuse. \"Physical, mental, verbal,\" Clark Freeman, Winkler's father, toldGood Morning America. \"I don't know how she took it. She's a stronger individual than I am.\" More than 10 years ago,Lisa Nowak, a former space shuttle astronaut, drove 14 hours from Houston to Orlando and pepper sprayed then-Air Force captain Colleen Shipman in an airport parking lot. Her motive? Shipman was the new girlfriend of her ex-boyfrriend. \"Nobody knew she had this infatuation thing going on,\" Shipman, speaking about Nowak, told PEOPLE. After the incident, the world learned that Nowak felt scorned by fellow astronaut Bill Oefelein, who told investigators he had ended a relationship with her as his romance with Shipman became more serious. As part of a plea agreement, Nowak pleaded guilty to burglary and misdemeanor battery, although she was initially arrested on charges of attempted murder and kidnapping. She served two days in jail and was sentenced to a year of probation along with 50 hours of community service. During a family trip to a resort in Portugal in 2007, Kate and Gerry McCann went out to dinner with friends, leaving their three sleeping children in their beds in their rented apartment, just 180 feet away. An hour and a half later, when Kate checked on the children, she discovered that her 3-year-old daughter, Madeleine, was missing. Portuguese authorities initially accused the British couple of being responsible for her disappearance, the mystery of which has deepened in the intervening years. She has never been found. In July 2007, two men broke into the Petit family’s Cheshire, Connecticut, home and bludgeoned father William Petit with a baseball bat and tied him to a pole in the basement. Then, the men – Joshua Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes – turned their attention to mom Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 38, and daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11. Hawke-Petit and Michaela were sexually assaulted before all three were killed. Both suspects were convicted of the crimes and sentenced to death, but werelater resentencedto life in prison. In 2016, Petit won a seat in the Connecticut state legislature, running as a Republican. Former Chicago-area cop Drew Peterson was convicted of killing his third wife, Kathleen Savio, and trying to hire a hitman to kill the prosecutor who convicted him. He is also under suspicion in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy, who has been missing since 2007. While Peterson maintains his innocence, his son Stephen said in 2017 that his father “probably killed” both wives. “Over time, you hear enough [from police],” Stephen Peterson said. “I don’t want to come out and say he did it … but, I’m sure he did it.” University of Virginia lacrosse player Yeardley Love, 22, wasfound deadin the bedroom of her off-campus apartment in Charlottesville, Va., in the early morning hours of May 3, 2010, having suffered physical trauma. Hours later, police arrested George Huguely, with whom Love had a romantic relationship she was trying to end. Huguely denied he intended to kill Love but admitted “he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and that during the course of the altercation he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall.” Huguely was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 23 years in prison in 2012. Two-year-old Caylee Anthony was reported missing on July 15, 2008. The following morning, her mother, Casey, was detained on charges of giving false statements to law enforcement, child neglect and obstruction of a criminal investigation. Six months later, Caylee’s remains were found – authorities said it appeared the child’s body had beenbound with duct tape– and Casey was charged with her murder. Casey Anthony was once describedby a Florida Department of Corrections spokeswomanas “one of the most hated women in America” — a moniker that stuck even as she was acquitted of Caylee’s murder. For more than five years, the parents of missingLisa Irwin— who disappeared in October 2011 from her crib just a few weeks shy of her first birthday — have insisted she was taken from their home in Kansas City, Missouri. Years after her disappearance, her father, who returned from work that night to fine her missing, told PEOPLE, “It’s always the last thing I do before I lay down and go to sleep: I tell her good night, and I give her a kiss.” Police don’t know what to believe, or who might be to blame. “It’s hard to say that somebodyisn’ta suspect when you don’t have any,” Kansas City police Maj. Steve Young told PEOPLE in 2016. “But truly, there isn’t anybody that is or isn’t.” On the evening of February 26, 2012, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin took a break from watching the NBA All-Star game on TV to run to a nearby convenience store for a snack. The high school junior bought some iced tea and candy and headed back to his father's fiancee's townhome in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. Shortly after 7 p.m., Martin was approached by George Zimmerman, the 28-year-old neighborhood watch coordinator. After a brief altercation, Zimmerman fatally shot Martin. A month after shooting, Zimmerman was charged with Martin's murder. His attorneys invoked Florida's \"Stand Your Ground\" law, claiming that Zimmerman, had shot the teen in self-defense. During a month-long trial, both the prosecution and defense produced witnesses with differing accounts of the shooting. On July 13, 2013, Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder charges, leading to protests across the country. Zimmerman, who has been arrested for aggravated assault twice since his release, has repeatedly maintained that he did nothing wrong in the shooting. Martin's parents have become prominent activists, speaking out about the shootings of unarmed black men. Between August 2002 and April 2004, three young women — Amanda Berry, then 17, Michelle Knight (who has since changed her name to Lily Rose Lee), then 21 and Gina DeJesus, then 14 —went missing in Cleveland. They were kidnapped by Ariel Castro, who kept them captive in his Cleveland house for ten years. All three women were raped and abused throughout their captivity, which lasted nearly a decade. Berry gave birth to a daughter, and Lee said she was impregnated five times, but miscarried each one after being beaten by Castro. In 2013, Berry escaped after getting a neighbor's attention, and called the police, who came to the house and found Lee and DeJesus. Castro was later sentenced to 1,000 years in prison, and committed suicide by hanging himself in his prison cell. Petite, blue-eyed, 19-year-old Erin Corwin had a secret. She’d been married for almost two years to her high school sweetheart, Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin, but she was having an affair with her married next-door neighbor, Marine Cpl. Christopher Lee, 25. Corwin vanished in June 2015, before her body wasfoundin a remote desert mine shaft two months later. Leeconfessedin court to strangling Erin and throwing her body down a 140-foot desert mineshaft. The day she died, Corwin was expecting Lee to propose to her. The judge inBill Cosby’s sexual assault trialdeclared a mistrialin June 2017 after a jury deadlocked. Cosby had been accused of drugging and sexually assaulting former Temple University employeeAndrea Constandin 2004 in his Pennsylvania mansion. More than 50 women have accused Cosby of similar behavior – though Cosby has denied all of the allegations. PEOPLE reported on the accusations that shocked the nation and forever complicated the legacy of the iconic comedian and “TV dad.” Ashton Sachs was an honors student, a trading-card fanatic and the kind of kid who taught residents at his grandmother’s nursing home how to use computers. In February, 2014, the 19-year-old also became the murderer of his parents in a shooting that also left his little brother paralyzed. Last October, Sachs was sentenced to life in prison. “The defendant is a sociopath,” the prosecutor said at his sentencing. “He has no remorse or empathy. All he cares about is himself.” On December 6, 2014, the body of 19-year-old Jessica Chambers was discovered badly burned but alive by first responders on Herron Road in Courtland, Mississippi, a town of just 500 people. Her death spawned suspicion and theories in her small town: Although she graduated from high school with A’s and B’s and held down a job, Chambers was running with a rough crowd prior to her death,ex-boyfriend Bryan Rudd told PEOPLE. But, in February 2015, prosecutors chargedQuinton Tellis, who grew up in the same neighborhood and attended the same high school as Jessica, after zeroing in on his phone records. Tellis is currently awaiting trial. “We knew he was the last person she was with,” the prosecutor said. During a family camping trip in the mountains of Idaho in 2015, 2-year-old DeOrr Kunz disappeared. Since then, there has been no sign of DeOrr or evidence of what happened to him has ever been found. DeOrr’s parents have beennamed suspectsin the disappearance of their son. They deny any involvement, but investigators allege their stories have been inconsistent and everyone at the campsite has “been less than truthful.” DeOrr’s father tells PEOPLE he still believes that his son was kidnapped, explaining, “Somebody has him and I’ll get him back because there’s just no evidence found. I believe that he was taken.” Eight years afterSteven Avery and Brendan Dasseywere convicted in the brutal murder of 25-year-old Wisconsin photographer Teresa Halbach, Netflix series had thousands asking: Are the right men in prison? Making a Murdererbecame a smash hit, with many convinced that Avery and Dassey were railroaded and justice was not served. Dassey’s conviction has since been overturned – a finding reaffirmed by an appeals court – and Avery’s appeal is still pending. However, Halbach’s familyhas rebuked the show, claiming it was one-sided. It’s been more than six years since police discoveredmore than 10 bodies around New York’s Gilgo Beach areaon Long Island — a grisly case that began whenShannan Gilbert, a 24-year-old escort, disappeared in May 2010 after meeting a client through Craigslist. To this day, the cases of Shannan and the other victims (almost all women)remain unsolved, and the mysteries surrounding their deaths endure. Plenty of theories about the killer – or killers – abound, including that the killer is a drifter, a fisherman, a seasonal worker or a commuter. But authorities can’t say for sure whether the killings are connected. Michelle Carter, a 20-year-old Massachusetts woman, was put on trial for involuntary manslaughter for urging the suicide of her boyfriend in a series of texts and phone calls. For instance, in the days before he killed himself by toxic fumes while sitting in his truck, she texted him, “You’re ready and prepared. All you have to do is turn the generator on and you [will] be free and happy. No more pushing it, no more waiting.” When Roy wavered on his plan to kill himself and exited the cab of the truck, Carter told him to get back in.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

During an appearance onCBS’Face the Nationon Sunday, Pence spoke in glowing terms about the president’sproposed compromiseto end theongoing government shutdown, which would offer temporary protection for some undocumented immigrants in exchange for $5.7 billion in wall funding. On Sunday’s show, which took place one day before the federal holiday honoring the late civil rights icon, Pence attempted to make a comparison between King and Trump, 72. “One of my favorite quotes from Dr. King was, ‘Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.’ You think of how he changed America. He inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union. That’s exactly what President Trump is calling on the Congress to do,” Pence, 59, remarked. “Come to the table in a spirit of good faith. We’ll secure our border, we’ll reopen the government and we’ll move our nation forward as the president said yesterday to an even broader discussion about immigration reform in the months ahead,” he added. As NBC News pointed out, King specificallyspoke out against the Berlin Wallshortly after giving the iconic speech at the Lincoln Memorial. “Here oneither side of the wall are God’s children, and no manmade barrier can obliterate that fact,” he said in 1964, during a visit to East Berlin.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: All Romay Davis wanted in her early 20s was to follow her five brothers into the U.S. military, leave the rural Virginia home she shared with her supportive parents and chase a little adventure along the way. She found it while making history in the first all-female, all-women-of-color unit to serve in the U.S. Army in World War II. Now, at age 102, as the oldest of six survivors of the groundbreaking 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, she's a new recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress can bestow. \"I was surprised,\" Davis tells PEOPLE of learning about the award. \"I'm still surprised, very much so because I didn't do anything out of the ordinary, except go in the military.\" She received her citation, which was approved by PresidentJoe Bidenin March for all 855 members of the unit, on Tuesday in Montgomery, Ala., from Col. Eries L.G. Mentzer, the first Black woman to command Maxwell Air Force Base. The presentation also marked the 74th anniversary of Executive Order 9981, which integrated the Armed Forces in 1948, several years after Davis enlisted. Davis knew she was bound for a female-only unit in Europe but downplayed its significance, then and now. \"What difference does it make?\" she remembers thinking. \"We do work just like anybody else. We learn, like anyone else.\" The base commander countered Davis' humble portrayal. \"It was not easy forRosa Parks,\" Col. Mentzer tell PEOPLE. \"It wasn't easy for Romay Davis. Frankly, my life and my career have not been easy. There's a constant pressure to be perfect, especially when you're the 'first' at something. You want to make sure that the work you're doing doesn't close the door for others, to give any reason to say, 'Well, look, we tried it once.'\" \"Despite what she was handed, despite the fact that there were so many barriers for her service, she persevered and she pushed to allow more freedom for people to serve our nation in the Armed Forces,\" she continues. \"I would not be here without Romay Davis,\" Col. Mentzer adds. Davis later worked for 30 years as a children's fashion designer, earned a Taekwondo black belt in her 70s and then spent two decades in her 80s and 90s stocking shelves for the Winn-Dixie grocery chain in Montgomery. She also paints and writes poetry. RELATED:Grocery Store Throws 100th Birthday Party for Employee Who 'Does More Work Than a 25-Year-Old' All these decades later, Davis credits her military service for jump-starting her full life. \"I had traveled and grown up with five boys, and my mother and father were very active people,\" she says. \"So I was in the active group, ready to do whatever was chosen for me to do.\" Among those brothers who enlisted ahead of her, Davis says two of them went into the Marines, one became a sailor, one worked as an aircraft airman and one was stationed in Hawaii with the U.S.O. \"My main reason for enlisting was my last brother,\" she says. \"When my baby brother left, I thought about it a few days, and I thought about my mom and pop being left by themselves.\" \"But I said, 'They could make it,' because they were younger and healthy and active, and I was also, and I wanted to be free to take the chance, to get the experience of being in a group and away from home.\" \"I talked it over with mom,\" she says. \"She wasn't necessarily a homebody. She was into whatever was going on. She was a very forward-looking person. Thank goodness for that.\" The female veterans of what became known as the \"Six Triple Eight\" served stateside and in Europe, says U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas, who sponsored the legislation awarding the medals. \"Though the odds were set against them, the women of the Six Triple Eight processed millions of letters and packages during their deployment in Europe, helping connect WWII soldiers with their loved ones back home — like my father and mother,\" Moran said in a news release. After serving \"two years, four months and three days, I think,\" Davis followed her time in the Women's Army Corps by relocating from her parents' home in King George County, Virginia, to New York City. An alum of New York University, she took up fashion because another career she coveted wasn't open to her. \"I wanted to be a doctor and I couldn't be at that time,\" she says. \"I chose design secondly.\" RELATED:Family Discovers New Va.

The two — both retired from military service — married after the war and were together about 47 years before he died in 1999. The couple did not have children. In 2019, Winn-Dixiecelebrated Davis' work for the grocery chain on her 100th birthday. \"It's unreal,\" store manager Bobby Godwin told theMontgomery Advertiserupon the occasion. \"She's doing more work than a 25-year-old.\" The pandemic sent Davis home against her will. \"I'm delicate and I catch anything that goes by me, but I've been very fortunate,\" she says. \"I was very healthy, for one thing. I'm old. I've admitted that I'm old, but I never thought about it before. Mama never taught us about watching your birthdays.\" Along with her citation — the actual medal will come later — on Tuesday Davis received a duplicate of the WWII uniform she wore, which was lost long ago. First Lady Dr. Jill Biden recently called to congratulate her. A representative of the Smithsonian Institution was on hand to document the ceremony. \"Think about Romay's service,\" says Col. Mentzer. \"She served in a segregated unit. She proudly wore the uniform of her nation and went overseas fighting fascism, working to spread democracy around the world, when she and people like her were denied democracy in America.\" \"I just think about the burden that she and the women of that unit had to bear,\" she adds. \"She worked in a rat-filled warehouse where they had to deal with sexism and racism in deplorable conditions. And yet they performed to such a high level of perfection that earned congressional medal recognition. That level of excellence is so inspiring.\" RELATED:Air Force Chief of Staff Gen.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: For nearly five decades, little was known aboutMary Jo Kopechne, the 28-year-old campaign worker for Robert F. Kennedy who tragically diedwhen the Oldsmobile Delmont 88 driven by his younger brother, Ted, went off a small wooden bridge in Chappaquiddick on July 18, 1969 — and she was left trapped inside. Chappaquiddick, a new movie opening April 6 that explores the events of that night and the week that followed — when Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident — has once again brought questions about what happened that evening to the forefront. Yet it has also brought attention to Mary Jo, whose story was long overlooked in the headlines that followed, which primarily focused on Kennedy and his thwarted political career. “For 49 years people have wanted to know what happened,” Mary Jo’s aunt Georgetta Potoski, 75, says in an exclusive interview in this week’s PEOPLE. “Maybe now Mary Jo will be brought to the forefront and remembered not just for how she died but for who she was.” Potoski and her son, William Nelson, 46, hope the film will convey something about the real Mary Jo, who was reduced at the time to what William calls “the quote-unquote ‘Girl in the Car.’ ” Mary Jo, who worked for RFK for four years, was in Chappaquiddick, off Martha’s Vineyard, that weekend for a reunion party for her fellow campaign workers — known as the “Boiler Room Girls,” and nicknamed for the campaign office in which they worked. For more on Mary Jo Kopechne’s life and tragic death, pick up the newest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday “She was so much more than a secretary,” says Potoski, who is two years younger than Mary Jo and always thought of her as a sister.  “JFK’s idea of ‘ What you can do for your country,’ she really tried to do that. She was devoted to Bobby. She wrote up all his personal correspondence and typed up his declaration to run for President.” Potoski also says “Mary Jo was devastated by his assassination.” “[Mary Jo and her co-workers] loved him and they loved Ethel and the kids,” Potoski continues. “They believed they had a mission and it was catastrophic when he was killed because everything they believed in all of a sudden was gone. They didn’t have a leader anymore.” Afterwards, she says Mary Jo “was trying to figure out what to do and how to process the brutality of what had happened to the Kennedy family. She and some of her co-workers were given the task of cleaning out his office. That was their last job for him.” After her death, Mary Jo’s parents, Gwen and Joe Kopechne, were “crushed” by rumors about their daughter and Sen. Kennedy that followed the accident. “There were all the innuendoes they were having an affair, or something salacious going on,” says Potoski, “but if you knew who she was, you’d know that didn’t happen. She was thinking of getting engaged, but no one came out to defend her, and her parents were broken — and they just retreated.” She adds that Mary Jo “wasn’t particularly fond” of Ted Kennedy. “They called him the office boy,” she says. “He was a young man finding his way around Washington, but he didn’t have the same focus that his brothers  had — at least not yet. He didn’t really impress her as picking up the standard for Bobby.” Nearly fifty years later, Mary Jo’s remaining family hopes the world will learn about the young woman they loved. “She was charming, she was funny, she was a little uptight,” says Potoski with a smile. “If you knew a dirty joke, you didn’t tell it to Mary Jo.” RELATED VIDEO: Jackie Kennedy Ironically Got Help From Marilyn Monroe’s Therapist During Her Darkest Days She also remembers how her niece “loved to jitterbug and she loved the Brooklyn Dodgers, she was a bit of a tomboy.” She also relished her career in Washington. “She really believed she could make a difference,” says Potoski,  who’s written a book with her son,Our Mary Jo, about her life. She alsolaunched a scholarship in her name at Misericordia College, to be given out for the first time this year. “There is no doubt she would have done great things in her life.” Meanwhile, Potoski’s son adds that “We’re happy more information is coming out — that’s the path to the truth.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: In a new Audible audio-only memoir, the music icon reveals how his tumultuous early years helped him forge a creative path and inspired some of his most enduring songs Getting toJames Taylor’s house in rural Western Massachusetts is like driving through one of his songs. It’s just after New Year’s and the Berkshires really do seem dreamlike on account of the frosting. A country road pierces the woods, leading to a small clearing. Go right and you’ll find the home that Taylor shares with his wife, Caroline “Kim” Smedvig, and18-year-old twin sons Rufus and Henry. It’s cozy and unimposing, save for the autographed photo of the Obamas that shares shelf space with family vacation photos. Go left and you’ll see his rustic recording studio, a large cedar-shingled structure dubbed “TheBarn.” Taylor himself is inside, his lean and long frame doubled over as he tends to the wood stove. The personal ritual, a way of literally sharing his warmth, is his own private moment of Zen. He’s an island of serenity amid a storm of studio activity, exuding the gentle but commanding presence of a kind professor. The 71-year-old has spent a lot of time in TheBarn recently, working hard on a pair of projects that revisit his roots. For many artists this is a simple nostalgia trip, but for Taylor it’s much more complicated. On Jan. 31 he will launchBreak Shot: My First 21 Years,an Audible Original audio-only memoir that traces his challenging pre-fame life, set against the socio-political upheaval of the 1960s. The title is a billiards term, describing the moment when the cue ball smashes into the neat triangle formation, sending balls careening in all directions. “It felt as though there was a point when that happened to my family,” he tells PEOPLE. “Things went from ordered and predictable to chaotic in a very short period of time.” He’ll follow the memoir up on Feb. 28 with his 19th studio album,American Standard, a largely acoustic take on the jazz and musical theater classics that provided a soundtrack to his childhood. A source of inspiration and comfort during his troubledBreak Shotera, these tunes are his musical bedrock. “I admire the craft of the professional songwriter,” he explains. “Today we don’t really separate the song from the performer. But there was a time when these songs were going to be sung by lots of different people, and songwriters wrote them to serve a function in a musical — to establish a character, or to carry the action along, or to set the atmosphere for the time and place. I really envy that ability to apply your songwriting craft to a project rather than self-expression and personal experience, as I do.” Taken together, these back-to-back releases represent the alchemy of Taylor’s artistry: intensely personal compositions written under the influence of 20th century masters. His inner turmoil and sophisticated melodies forged songs like “Fire & Rain,” “Carolina in My Mind” and “Frozen Man,” which have become American Standards in their own right. For Taylor, revisiting his early years from a contemporary vantage point was “clarifying,” if not particularly pleasurable. He compares the process toGroundhog Day,one of his favorite movies. “It’s the idea that you have to keep on repeating the same thing until you can come away from it, finish it and go forward. Almost like the idea of reincarnation; having to go through the cycle until you get it right and then you can move on.” Taylor’s present lifetime began on March 12th, 1948 in Boston.He was born into an intellectual clan driven by ambition and personal demons in equal measure. His father, Dr. Isaac Taylor, was chief resident at Massachusetts General Hospital until he relocated the family to his native North Carolina, cradle of Taylor family ancestral trauma rooted in addiction, depression and an almost Gothic series of personal tragedies. Soon after they arrived, Dr. Taylor accepted a Naval position in Antarctica. For two years, Dr. Taylor’s urbane, Boston-bred wife, Trudy, acted as a single mother, raising their five children in an unfamiliar locale. Even after Dr. Taylor returned from the assignment (he went on to serve as Dean of the University of North Carolina School of Medicine at Chapel Hill), the rift between them never fully mended. For a time, the rumbles of marital discontent were drowned out by music. The Taylor household was filled with the progressive folk of Pete Seeger, the raw blues of Lead Belly, the biting satire of Tom Lehrer, and show tunes by the likes of Lerner & Loewe and Rodgers & Hammerstein. Trudy even brought the kids up to New York City by train to catch the latest Broadway productions. “My mom really was very active in finding things for us to do,” he says. “She was very dedicated to educating us and exposing us to new things. She made sure we spoke a second language, made sure everybody got the experience of being on the stage with theater groups. And she made sure we played a musical instrument.” Taylor took up the cello, until the R&B records brought home by his older brother Alex spurred him to switch to guitar. But his repertoire wasn’t just the usual rocker setlist. “I played a lot of hymns and Christmas carols; whatever I could think of to express myself.” His young life grew complicated as his family started to disintegrate around him. “My parents were in crisis,” he recalls. “Their marriage was coming apart. My dad’s drinking got out of control. He was very functional, but it overwhelmed him. All this happened at a moment when you really need your family to guide you and give you support.” As elder brother Alex rebelled against the collegiate path laid out by their parents, James found himself bearing the full weight of his family’s hopes. The rising tensions quickly overwhelmed the 17-year-old. Enrolled at a prestigious Massachusetts boarding school, he sank into a deep depression and his grades plummeted. “I had been the ‘non-f— up kid’ who was probably going to make something of himself. My father was a star student and a great doctor. I was in the position of fulfilling the expectations of the family, but I wasn’t getting any information because they were in such crisis. I was an unhappy camper and I basically flamed out.” At the advice of friends, he checked into McLean psychiatric hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts, where he was treated for 10 months. Looking back, he cites this as his “break shot” moment and spent much of the period numb and lost. As he would later sing on 1991’s “Copperline,” he was only living until the end of the week. “I really didn’t think of the future at all,” he says. “I didn’t think there wouldbea future.” But the pain was replaced with a sense of relief, and then a feeling of strength. He had broken away from the life prescribed by his family. Now, he was free. “There was a moment when it became clear to me that I could do music for a living. That was a wonderful thing. So I just followed the music.” He followed it to New York City, where he met up with Danny “Kootch” Kortchmar, a childhood friend and musical collaborator he’d met on his family’s summer trips to Martha’s Vineyard. Together they formed a band, The Flying Machine, and played a regular gig at a Greenwich Village club called The Night Owl. Despite early promise, the group never get off the ground. The bitter disappointment drove Taylor to seek solace in heroin, and self-medication quickly escalated into addiction. Out of money and options, he made a desperate call to his father. Dr. Taylor rescued his boy, driving him 13 hours from New York back home to North Carolina. The act of fatherly devotion, later immortalized in Taylor’s song “Jump Up Behind Me,” gave him a new chance at life. “That was a moment when my dad was really there for me.” After a period of recovery, music called him again, this time to London. “I went over with my guitar to visit a friend. I didn’t have plans to come back.” He arrived in late 1967, when the British capital was the epicenter of the Swinging Sixties. An intro from Kootch led him straight to the kings of the scene — the Beatles, who were seeking acts for their new record label, Apple. Before he knew it, Taylor went from busking in the street to auditioning for the most famous musicians on the planet. “I was nervous, but I was young. Your brain’s half-baked,” he laughs now. “I sat down and played ‘Something in The Way She Moves,’ for Paul [McCartney] and George [Harrison].” The Fabs liked what they heard. (In fact, Harrison liked it so much that he borrowed the opening lines for his own composition, “Something,” a short time later.) They offered James a contract, but at 19 he was too young to sign. Once again, he reached out to his father, but this time he did so with pride. “Signing to the Beatles’ label got my dad’s attention. He said, ‘Maybe this thing’s going to work out for James after all.'” With Apple A&R man Peter Asher acting as producer, Taylor recorded his first album in the fall of 1968 — literally following the Beatles into London’s Trident Studios after they had recorded “Hey Jude” and tracks for ‘The White Album.’ For a young artist, the experience was both intimidating and inspiring. “It was like, ‘Holy cow, I can’t believe this.’” His self-titled debut was released that December, but it got lost in the shuffle of Apple’s increasingly dire business problems. “I’m sure Apple was hemorrhaging money like crazy. Nobody was really paying attention to running it like a commercial venture. If it was going to break even, or even lose a little bit, that was fine with the Beatles. While it was open, it was a real resource. It was great.” His time on the label would be short-lived, but Taylor’s London excursion paved the way for the success just around the corner. By 1969 he’d moved to Los Angeles with Asher to record his commercial breakthrough,Sweet Baby James. Though barely 20, he’d already endured enough pain to last several lifetimes, and he channeled it into the album’s emotional centerpiece, “Fire and Rain.” Inspired by the suicide of a friend and his own continued battle with addiction, the stunningly frank confessional became his first hit, establishing him as a leading musical voice for the 1970s. Though naïve — and perhaps foolish — to suggest that notoriety wasn’t at least part of his early goal, the sudden spotlight of celebrity caught Taylor off guard. “There was a meteoric change in how things were in my life and my position, [in regard to] the amount of attention I got. That was pretty confusing for a while,” he admits. The global superstardom that landed him on the cover ofTIMEin May 1971 came as an almost unintentional byproduct. His songs, born of intimate moments and written chiefly to provide comfort to himself, soothed millions who imbued them with their own private meanings. “We often use popular culture to assemble our own personal mythology,” he observes. “For instance, a heartbreak song would help you get over a romantic reversal or ‘Fire and Rain’ would help you get through a rough time in your freshman year in college, or losing a friend. We really do use these performances to support us. People tell me they’ve played ‘You Can Close Your Eyes’ at their mom’s funeral or that they got married to ‘How Sweet It Is’, or ‘You Are My Only One.’ When someone tells you that, that means you made something that really worked for them and had some use for them…An artist looks for that connection with somebody else.” More than just a career, music became a method to manage the maelstrom inside himself. “When you have strong emotions and internal challenges, there’s something about expressing it, getting it out in front of you in some kind of form, that tends to exorcise or expiate and relieve it somehow.” Making music helped him make sense of the turmoil that seemed to plague his bloodline. A brief scan of his family history makes one wonder if a sense of trans-generational trauma was at play. Taylor wonders, too. “I think some thoughts, feelings and impressions are passed on,” he says. “My mother always had a terrible dream when she was a child of seeing someone hung, drawn and quartered, which used to be the worst way to administer capital punishment. She didn’t find out that such a thing had existed in history until she was almost finished with high school. When someone described that in a history class she said, ‘Oh my God, I’ve been dreaming about this since I was 5!’ She always entertained the possibility that somebody among her forebears witnessed such a thing and it made such an indelible impression that it became passed on.” The repeated themes that crop up in Taylor’s songs seem to be a manner of working out a psychic knot, not unlike his mother’s recurring dreams. “I have limited subject matter. I actually went through my songs at one point and categorized them. There are songs about my father, or that are strongly connected to my father. There are songs about my family at large. There are spirituals for agnostics, like ‘Up from Your Life,’ or ‘Gaia,’ or ‘Migration.’ There are some songs that sort of complain about show business: ‘Hey, Mister, That’s Me Up on the Jukebox,’ or ‘Company Man.’ Then [there are] certain kinds of love songs, and some recovery songs. I keep circling back and coming at things again and again.” For years, another recurring theme in his life was addiction. His struggles with heroin contributed to the collapse of his first marriage to fellow singer-songwriterCarly Simon, with whom he shares daughter Sally, 46, and son Ben, 43. “It’s unfair to have a relationship with someone with an addiction,” he says today. “It’s like there’s a third party in the room.I definitely was not ready to be a decent partner or a good parent.” The drug-related deaths of friends John Belushi and Beach Boy Dennis Wilson served as a wake-up call, and by 1983 he’d decided he’d had enough of the destructive repetition familiar to addicts. “I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. I’d had too many of what we call ‘jackpots,’ or moments when you’re just humiliated by your own behavior.” He joined a 12-step program, which he considers “one of the most inspired developments of our modern times,” and put in the work. To heal, he went back to before the “break shot” occurred. “If you have a substance problem, it can be a case of arrested development. You don’t learn to risk yourself and then get rewards for it. You short-circuit all of that and go straight to the chemical reward in your brain. So you find yourself at the age of 35, as I did when I got clean, having to go back to when you were 18 years old and learn all that stuff. And it’s humbling.” In 2020, Taylor will celebrate 37 years sober and 25 years with Kim Smedvig, a musician and former director of marketing for the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Married since February 2001, she’s been his muse for standout recent songs like “You and I Again,” in which Taylor playfully wonders whether they loved one another lifetime. “When I met Kim, it felt so familiar so immediately that it seemed like we had known each other before. I was so amazed by how synchronized we were and how much we had in common,” he says. “I wouldn’t change anything that I have done or any of the people I’ve been with. I love those women very much, but I’m really lucky I found Kim. That’s what it comes down to for me.” Their twin sons are preparing to graduate the same Massachusetts school where Taylor dropped out, at the precise moment when his own life “went off the rails.” Yet he doesn’t fear that they’ll endure the same heartbreak he faced at that age. “They have much more strength than I did,” he says with obvious pride. “Theydothink of the future.” The creative forces that first compelled him to write are still going strong. Sometimes they strike while he’s out for a drive. “I’ll have to pull over to the side of the road and put it down,” he says. More often it comes when he’s out for a walk. “That’s a gift out of the blue. Then there’s a second phase where I start to organize the music as an idea for a song,” He starts by making a notebook for each composition, writing lyric drafts on the right side and potential alternatives on the left. The refining continues for 10 pages or more. He repeats the process again and again, going through the cycle until he gets it right. And then he can move on. Despite all of his success, he sees himself as a humble and dedicated craftsman, in the mold of the tunesmiths found onAmerican Masters. Even though, for many, his music is completely singular, he feels he’s very much part of a continuum. He compares it to Japanese master artisans who produce woodblock prints, monochromatic brush paintings, textiles or pottery. “These art forms are ancient and have been traditionally practiced the same way forever and ever. The artisan will commit their life that art form. Maybe they’ll add one half of one percent change to it. I like that idea that you’re basically picking up something that somebody else put down, and you’re carrying it on. And then whoever wants to pick it up from there. I like that way of thinking about an artist’s life.” The one half of one percent change that Taylor introduced to the popular songbook has left an indelible mark, earning him praise from the likes ofPaul McCartney,Bob Dylan(a big fan of “Frozen Man”), Miles Davis (“You sing like a blind man!” he told him),Garth Brooks(who named his daughter after Taylor),Stingand so many others. He was invited to sing at Barack Obama’s second inauguration in 2013, and performed for the administration more than any other artist, yet Taylor still takes humility to the level of fine art. When recalling the timeAretha Franklincited him as the artist she’d most like to sing with, Taylor starts to wonder if she was referring toanotherJames Taylor, the lead singer for Kool & the Gang.  He is, by all appearances, completely serious — and almost certainly mistaken. Revisiting his own history thoughBreak ShotandAmerican Standardhas helped Taylor make sense of his own tumultuous past and how he broke his family’s cycle of unhappiness through the clarity of music. In this lifetime, he got it right. “An artist is forced by their life circumstances to find a new way of dealing with a problem, and sometimes they blaze a trail that leads to a solution — one that other people can use. It’s hugely gratifying. All I ever wanted to do was to play music and to have people enjoy it, occasionally use it in their lives, and make it part of their world. That’s a great feeling.” For more on James Taylor’s road to fame and peace through music, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE — on newsstands Friday.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

And just to clear things up for people who would rather believe sensationalist headlines than do their own research about the nature of this virus—I am not currently sick,\" shewrote in the caption, sharing a screenshot of a news article about research for a coronavirus vaccine. \"When you test positive for anti-bodies it means you HAD the virus which I. clearly did as I was sick at the end of my tour in Paris over 7 weeks ago along with many other artists in my show but at the time,\" she added. \"We all thought we had a very bad flu. Thank God we are all healthy and well now.\" Madonna continued, \"Hope that clears things up for the band wagon jumpers!! Knowledge is Power! #covid19\" On May 3, the60 Minuteshost revealed thatshe recently recovered from COVID-19, and wasn't the only employee at theCBS Newsprogram to contract the virus. She revealed that some coworkers showed no symptoms and others suffered from \"almost every symptom you can imagine.\" \"One of the rules of journalism is 'Don't become part of the story,' but instead of covering the pandemic, I was one of the more than 1 million Americans who did become part of it,\" shesaid during the broadcast. Stahl said she spent two weeks in bed \"weak, fighting pneumonia and really scared\" before she decided to go to the hospital. \"I found an overworked, nearly overwhelmed staff,\" she recalled of the hospital. \"Every one of them kind, sympathetic, gentle and caring from the moment I arrived until the moment days later when I was wheeled outthrough a gauntlet of cheering medical workers.\" She added: \"In the face of so much death, they celebrate their triumphs.\" The illusionist of Siegfried & Roy fame hastested positive, but is on the road to recovery, according to his publicist. \"We can confirm that Roy Horn has tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and is currently responding well to treatment,\" his publicist toldABC Newsin astatementon April 28. \"Most importantly, Siegfried & Roy send positive wishes to everyone impacted by the pandemic,\" the statement continued. \"We will have no further comment on Roy’s recovery at this time and ask everyone to respect his right to privacy.\" Horn and his partner Siegfried Fischbacher are perhaps best known for their Las Vegas show at the Mirage Resort and Casino that ran from 1990 until 2003, when Horn was attacked on stage by one of the white tigers used in the duo's act. Runaway June's Wayne has decided toshare her positive diagnosisand how she's been handling her symptoms on Instagram. \"I’ve been struggling with whether or not to share, because to be honest it’s kind of rocked me and I wasn’t sure that putting it on a public platform was right for me,\" she began on April 15. \"But as I’ve been telling people, I’ve had so many people reach out and say they have/had the virus and what did I do, what were my symptoms etc. So anyway, I am sharing this because I did contract Covid 19 (I’m assuming from the grocery store, it’s the only place I’ve been?!) and I had some great advice from doctors and friends and family (@travelingwithfinn !)... and this helped me kick this things ass.\" The singer made sure to preface that “each body’s immune system fights it off in a different way, so I am definitely not saying I have any answers” before listing the methods she used to feel better. “I loaded up on Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, B complex; chaga mushrooms and ZINC!” she began. “I also drank more water and Gatorade [than] I ever have in my life. I wanted to flush that thing out of my system,” noting that her routine plus getting rest was a “lifesaver.” As she recovers from the virus, Wayne said her next move will be “donating [her] blood and plasma to help others.” The singer also included a picture of herself holding up a sign that noted three things she is grateful for. Wayne’s list read: No. 1, “My parents did not get the virus,” No. 2, “My body, which I have so harshly judged in the past, fought it off and kept me healthy,” and No. 3, “I have had incredible family and friend support. I am a lucky girl.” According to wife Amanda Kloots, Cordero was \"fighting for his life\" after contracting the virus in early April. At the time of his initial diagnosis, the Broadway star seemed to be in \"stable condition\" but as of April 10, Kloots said he's in \"very bad\" shape. “My whole world has stopped. Please pray for my husband,”she wrote, alongside a photograph of the pair with their young son Elvis Eduardo. “Prayer warriors, prayer circles, whatever you’ve got. Energy, meditation, positive thinking. He is fighting for his life right now. Elvis and I need you Nick Cordero. It’s time to fight daddy. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻” “All prayer warriors right now PLEASE. Nicks condition got very bad. Please pray pray pray,” she added on her Instagram Story, alongside another photo of her husband and their son. Then on April 19, Kloots gave anotherupdate on her husband’s recovery, revealing that he is on the mend after getting hisright leg amputatedas a result of coronavirus-related complications. “An uneventful day in the [Intensive Care Unit] is a GOOD DAY!! HALLELUJAH!” Koots wrote on her Instagram Story. “It seems like Nick’s body is responding well to his surgery and recovering well,” she added. “I asked for a miracle yesterday because my spirits were low and I think we got one today. He is alive and recovering well.” By late April, Kloots was thrilled to report that Cordero had \"two negative COVID tests\" on her Instagram Stories. Cheering alongside their son over the \"good news,\" Kloots told fans on April 24 that the negative tests could mean that \"the virus is out of his system, and now we're just dealing with recovery and getting his body back from all the repercussion of the virus.\" She added that \"hopefully the virus is out of Nick\" after the negative results. \"Thank God!\" she said. Denver Broncos starMiller has tested positive, his agent, Joby Branion of Vanguard Sports Group, told PEOPLE in a statement on April 16. “He is at home resting and in good spirits with plans to speak publicly on the matter tomorrow,” the statement read. The Broncos alsoconfirmed Miller’s diagnosis in a separate statement on their website, saying he was tested positive for the virus after “experiencing flu-like symptoms.” “Von has elected to share his diagnosis publicly to emphasize that anyone can be afflicted with coronavirus,” the statement read. “Von is doing well and recovering at home in self-isolation. He remains under the care of team doctors, who are following all coronavirus treatment procedures to ensure a safe environment for Von and our community.” The CNN host announced that he hastested positive for COVID-19on March 31. “Sooooo in these difficult times that seem to get more difficult and complicated by the day, I just found out that I am positive for coronavirus,” he said in a statement posted toTwitter. “I have been exposed to people in recent days who have subsequently tested positive and I had fever, chills and shortness of breath.” Cuomo said he’s quarantined in his basement and will continue airing his CNN show,Cuomo Prime Time, from there. “I just hope I didn’t give it to the kids and Cristina,” he continued of his children and wife. “That would make me feel worse than this illness!” Then on April 15, Cuomo revealed that hiswife Cristina has also contracted the virus. “Cristina now has COVID. She is now positive, and it just breaks my heart,” Cuomo said during his show in a virtual interview withhis brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. “It is the one thing I was hoping wouldn’t happen and now it has.” The journalist also opened up about his wife’s condition onTwitter, writing, “Families all over know the reality our family faces: few are one case and done. Sure enough, Cristina has covid now. Kids are still healthy but this shook us at our literal core. All are stepping up. Can’t wait to shake this fever so I can help her as she helped me. Sucks.” Chris and Cristina have been married for more than 19 years. They share three children: Bella, 17, Mario, 14, and Carolina, 11. The news anchor announced onGood Morning Americathathe tested positive, but hasn't experienced any symptoms. “I’ve never had a fever, never had chills, never had a headache, never had a cough, never had shortness of breath,” Stephanopoulos said. “I’m feeling great.” Stephanopoulos continued to tell co-anchorsMichael StrahanandRobin Robertsthat it was “no surprise” that he contracted the virus since he was in close quarters with his wife — whoopened up about struggling with COVID-19in an April 1Instagram post— caring for her as they self-quarantine in their New York home. He said he took the test, however, “fully expecting it to be negative” since he didn’t feel any obvious symptoms. “There was one night, several weeks ago, when I went to bed early with some lower back pain and I thought it was from a hard workout that day, and it cleared up the next morning,” he explained. “Then several days after that I had one day when I had a diminished sense of smell, but that was it for my symptoms over the last several weeks.” Stephanopoulos also shared that his wife is feeling a lot better now. The country music star revealed on April 11 that nearly a month after first exhibiting symptoms for COVID-19, he was finally able to get a test and was toldhe tested positive. Simpson explained that it was really difficult to get tested in an Instagram post he wrote on April 12. He began by sharing that he had been on tour in Western Europe for two weeks before continuing in the U.S. up until March 12. The next day, he said his wife took him to their local hospital ER \"due to chest pains, fever, and pre-stroke blood pressure levels.\" \"I spent an hour listening to a (highly condescending) Doctor refuse to test me because I 'did not fit testing criteria' and tell me why it was impossible that I had contracted the virus due to its extreme rarity and that it was not in western Europe yet during that same period (which we now know is incorrect) even though I was told by two nurses that I was the first person their hospital had walk in requesting to be tested,\" he wrote. \"Almost one month later on April 6th my wife and I were both tested after finally finding a free drive-thru testing facility outside a National Guard depot.\" By April 10, the star recieved a call from the Nashville CDC and found out he was positive, while his wife's test came back negative. \"I should also add that the CDC nurse I spoke to yesterday told me that it reacts differently in a case by case basis and the White House briefings and the information they are providing is basically pure speculation causing fear and that the only thing anybody knows is that we don’t really know much yet,\" he continued. TheSound and Furyartist added, “All I know is I first felt symptoms a month ago yet I’m still positive and contagious and now on quarantine in the dojo until April 19th and really wishing I’d taken my wife’s advice and put a bathroom in the floor plans..live and learn.” Simpson then criticized PresidentDonald Trumpand the U.S. government’s response to the ongoing crisis. “At least our Government appointed task force headed by a man who does not believe in science is against mass testing and we now have a second task force in the works to ‘open America back up for business’!” he concluded. Babyface and his familyhad tested positive but have since recoveredfrom the virus, the singer revealed in anInstagram poston April 10. The star opened up about his diagnosis after thanking his followers for wishing him a happy birthday. “I feel so blessed to be able to celebrate another birthday,” he wrote. “I tested positive for the Covid 19 virus, as did my family. It’s an incredibly scary thing to go through my friends. I am happy to report we have now tested negative and are on our way back to full health.” Edmonds went on to announce his upcoming appearance on Swizz Beatz and Timbaland‘sVerzuzInstagram series, in which he’ll participate with singer-songwriter Teddy Riley in “a Celebration of Black Music Excellence.” “So get ready for a night of groove and love,” he wrote. “Ladies… put on your red dress…light some candles, pour some wine, and don’t forget to bring your dancing shoes.” The famed restarateur, known for celeb hotspots including Balthazar and Pastis in N.Y.C.,posted to Instagramthat he was in a London hospital with coronavirus, feeling \"totally weak\" and receiving oxygen. Hefollowed up with Eaterto say that he was recovering slowly, but \"unfortunately, my appetite and sense of humour have gone totally missing.\" TheChrisley Knows Beststar is recovering aftercontracting the novel virus. On the April 8 episode of hisChrisley Confessionspodcast, he explained that he was recently hospitalized to receive treatment for COVID-19. He recounted the harrowing ordeal, sharing that he had been “battling corona” for three weeks and hospitalized for four and a half days before being released back home. “It has been the sickest that I have ever been in the 52 years I’ve been on this earth,” he said. “I cannot ever tell you a time in my life where I have ever been as sick as what I had been with the coronavirus.” “This is serious. This is something that we’ve been dealing with for the past few weeks,” Todd’s wife,Julie Chrisley, chimed in. “Todd and I have been together for 25 years, I have never in 25 years seen him as sick as what he was in the past few weeks.” She continued, “If you are doubting or have not been affected by corona personally … you need to know that this is serious. There are people who are dying and we have to take it seriously. We have to practice social distancing, and we have to stay in if at all possible.” TheReal Housewives of New Jerseystar and mother of five revealed in anInstagram videoon April 8 that she hadtested positiveand is currently quarantined in her Paramus, New Jersey, home. She is away from her husband Bill and their five young children (daughters Gabriella, 12, and Olivia, 7, and sons Justin, 15, Jacob, 11, and Christian, 8). “Keeping my kids away has been the hardest,” Aydin said. “Bill’s really stepped up to the plate — he’s staying far, far away from me but he’s helping with the kids, which I’m grateful for.” The star explained in her video that she started feeling symptoms on March 30, including extreme fatigue and a cough. Her husband — a plastic surgeon — got her a test days later, and she received a positive diagnosis on April 6. “I’ve been doing better now which is why I’m checking in,” she said of her current state. “There are a few rough days where I was just extremely tired and sleeping a lot. I had this very dense headache and extreme, extreme night sweats. I lost my sense of taste and smell. I have no breathing problems. I feel better today. I feel like it’s going in the right direction.” “I will keep you guys posted on how I’m feeling,” she added. “I hope everyone is well and staying home, ’cause right now that’s what we have to do. We have to stay home to prevent the spread of this awful disease. Remember guys, we’re in this together. Stay safe, be well.” The star revealed that she and her 3-year-old son were showing symptoms of coronavirus beforeshe officially tested positive. “Two weeks ago my three-year old son, Jameson, and I are were showing symptoms of COVID-19. Fortunately, our primary care physician had access to tests and I tested positive,” Pinkwrote on Instagramon April 3. “My family wasalready sheltering at homeand we continued to do so for the last two weeks following the instruction of our doctor. Just a few days ago we were re-tested and are now thankfully negative,” she wrote. The “So What” singer took note of her privilege in being able to receive a test. “It is an absolute travesty and failure of our government to not make testing more widely accessible,” she continued. “This illness is serious and real. People need to know that the illness affects the young and old, healthy and unhealthy, rich and poor, and we must make testing free and more widely accessible to protect our children, our families, our friends and our communities.” Now that she is once again healthy, Pink is doing her part to help those who are battling the virus. “In an effort to support the healthcare professionals who are battling on the frontlines every day, I am donating $500,000 to the Temple University Hospital Emergency Fund in Philadelphia in honor of my mother, Judy Moore, who worked there for 18 years in the Cardiomyopathy and Heart Transplant Center,” she wrote. “Additionally, I am donating $500,000 to the City of Los Angeles Mayor’s Emergency COVID-19 Crisis Fund,” she added. “THANK YOU to all of our healthcare professionals and everyone in the world who are working so hard to protect our loved ones. You are our heroes!” The musician concluded by urging her followers to follow stay-at-home orders and social distancing guidelines, writing, “these next two weeks are crucial: please stay home. Please. Stay. Home.❤️” “Dear Friends, I’m sorry to report that I am among the growing number of Americans whotested positive for the COVID-19 virus,\" the singer posted on Facebook on April 3. \"I’m not in the habit of discussing medical issues on social media, but I do so in hope this will help other people to understand how serious and how contagious this illness is.” The Grammy winner, best known for his ’80s songs “Sailing” and “Arthur’s Theme (Best That You Can Do),” also shared how the virus has affected his health. “Although I am fortunate enough to be cared for at home, this is possibly the worst illness I’ve ever had,” Cross said. “For those of you who still do not believe the COVID-19 virus is real, or think it is a ‘hoax’ or part of some conspiracy, my advice to you is to understand right now that this is a deadly illness spreading like wildfire throughout the world.” In addition, the star urged his fans to follow the safety guidelines to prevent the spread of the pandemic, adding a link to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). “PLEASE make every attempt to stall the spread of this virus by: 1) staying home- the only way we can stop the spread right now is by self-quarantine 2) washing your hands as many times a day as you can and don’t touch your face and 3) follow the SCIENCE,” Cross said. “Importantly, please read the guidelines posted at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to educate yourself on the facts and protect your loved ones.” The musician concluded his post, writing, “Last but never least: wherever you are in the world, let’s all be kind to one another. Only if we work together can we defeat COVID-19. Love, Christopher.” The singerrevealed on her Instagram Storiesthat she\"had\" COVID-19 and has since \"fully recovered.\" She told her followers, \"Just wanted to check in. I’m really quiet right now and will probably continue to be quiet. Just sort of taking all of this in and having a lot of feelings as I do.\" She added, “I had it, just so you know. I’m fully recovered, just so you know.” She concluded her message to fans with, \"I am just thinking about all of the people who are walking through this really tricky time and sending a lot of love and just being really grateful for every easy breath and every day that I get to be walking around,” she said. “Lots of love, you guys. Take care of yourselves.” Later, Bareilles updated her fans on her Instagram Stories writing, \"Thank you all for the concern. I had a VERY MILD case of COVID and am counting my blessings for that... I am totally fine and fully recovered. Couple of rough days but I promise I'm fine.\" To prove it, she posted multiple silly videos of her dancing to Earth, Wind and Fire's \"September.\" The Tony winner, 56, revealed he was sick for the last two weeks aftertesting positive for the highly contagious virusduring his appearance onBroadway.com’sLive at Fiveshowon April 2. “Went to my doctor, got tested, got my positive results back and spent two weeks really brutally sick,” he shared. \"I clearly came through it and am two-and-a-half weeks now symptom-free and feel great.” He told viewers, \"Given everything we’re hearing and understand about it now, I consider myself profoundly lucky. I only ever got really sick. I never needed to be at an emergency room or at a hospital. I had a doctor monitoring me the whole time. I was very lucky. I came out okay and feel like myself again.\" The former Saints placekickertested positive for COVID-19 on March 26after being taken to a hospital the day before because he hadexhibited symptoms, his family told Nola.com. Dempsey had initially returned to his apartment at the Lambeth House —the retirement community he has lived in since 2012— in New Orleans, and was given medication. Dempsey is now in hospice care following a downturn in his health. “Hey friends, family and Stokes folks, I hope you all are well. I’ve been laying low for the last number of days because I could feel my body fighting something unusual, and I just got confirmation that I have indeedtested positive for the coronavirus,” the Tony Award-winning actor said in a Twitter video he posted on April 1. “The good news is, over the last few days I’ve isolated myself, I come to you from the bedroom,” Mitchell added, giving a sweet shout out to wife Allyson Tucker and their son, Ellington, who he said have been “100 percent asymptomatic and really helpful getting me through this.” “I love you guys so much, thank you for everything you’ve been doing for me,” the actor said. The former St. Louis Cardinal revealed on his Instagram Story on April 1 that he hadtested positive, but is now feeling better. In late March,Edmonds was hospitalized for symptoms he believed to be related to coronavirus, a trip he also documented on social media. He was told at the time he had pneumonia but would have to wait for the COVID-19 test results to come back. Since then, Edmonds has remained in quarantine at hisSt. Louis homeand says he’s now back in good health. “I am completely symptom-free now doing really well, so I must have had it for awhile before I got tested,” he said. “Thank god I quarantined myself and listened to what everyone said and kept our curve in our house flattened. I’m doing really good and happy to be symptom-free and feeling great.” “Do not take this lightly,” he stressed. “If you don’t feel good, go to the doctor or go to the emergency room if you can’t breathe. That’s what happened to me, they didn’t want to test me and I forced them to take me into the emergency room and low and behold, pneumonia and the virus. So don’t take it lightly. Take care of yourselves. There’s no medicine, there’s no nothing but rest and that’s all I’ve been doing.” He went on to thank his fans for their support. “I appreciate everyone who has said well-wishes and wished me the best,” he said. “All of you people, thank you so much again. Hope you all are doing well.” “I havetested positive for the Corona Virus,” the actress posted onInstagramon April 1. “I’ve never been sicker,” she continued, before describing some of her symptoms. “High fever. Horrific body aches. Heavy chest.” Sharing a photo of her lying in bed with her dog, she added, “I’m quarantined from my family. This is pure misery.” The news comes just after her husband,George Stephanopoulos, said onGood Morning Americathat Wentworth had “developed some symptoms” while explaining to viewers why he is broadcasting from his home. The former tennis player and ESPN commentatortalked about his diagnosisin a Twitter video on March 30, telling his followers that he’s been self-isolating in the basement of his home in Westchester County, New York, for “11 days” after coming down with “some minor symptoms.” “My test just came back positive. I just got it this morning,” he said, explaining he got examined at a drive-thru testing site. “It did come back positive — that’s the bad news.” He continued, “The good news is: I feel fine. My symptoms have passed. I feel really 100 percent.” McEnroe then praised his wife, Broadway starMelissa Errico, for “taking care of the house” while the family has been in “full quarantine … for well over two weeks.” \"Well folks, the bad news I've contracted the corona virus!!\" thecountry star announced on Facebookon March 31. \"Been feeling tired for about 10 days! Went to be tested on the 21st! No tests so went home! Went back yesterday feelin the same tired out of it and they tested ... first call this mornin from lab sayin you got it!!\" Benson assured his followers, “I’ll be ok,” before adding, “Sure do miss playin music and seein everyone.” Benson went on to urge his fans to “stay well” as “this s—- serious!! I have been alone for the most part and wore mask, washed hands, used hand sanitizer [and] still got it! Do not listen to the right wing BS!” Fountains of Wayne singer (and the songwriter behind \"That Thing You Do\") Schlesingercontracted the virusin late March, and did not recover from it. At the time, those close to Schlesinger refuted reports that he was in a coma while attempting to battle the virus. “He’s very sick and is heavily sedated, as are all people on ventilators, but no one has used the word ‘coma’ to me,” Schlesinger’s longtime lawyer, Josh Grier, toldVariety. On Aoril 1, however, Grier confirmed toRolling StonethatSchlesinger diedfrom complications related to the virus. He was 52 years old. Grier and Schlesinger’s agent did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment. “Despite being quarantined (except for a handful of trips for groceries) for three weeks, I managed tocontract COVID 19,” the singer tweeted on March 30,later adding that“I was at my worst a week ago, the test results finally came in today.” “I’m feeling significantly better, but it’s proof how dangerous and contagious this is.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Biden has experienced hiccups and dramatic comebacks in his push for the White House since his April 2019 announcement Joe Bidenhas long said there’s heightened stakes surrounding the 2020 presidential election. “Everything that has made AmericaAmericais at stake,” he warned in April 2019 when announced his run for president. Four years after Biden deferred in the 2016 campaign following his son Beau’s death, the former vice president cast PresidentDonald Trumpan incompetent leader who's destroying U.S. democracy. “I cannot stand by and watch that happen,” Biden, 77, declared. But while the Democratic nominee has long argued this year's race is a “battle for the soul of the nation,” it’s safe to say 2020 was more tumultuous and unpredictable than he, or anyone, could've imagined. The country's future is now in voters’ hands, after he and Trump, 74, exhausted the American electorate with jabs back-and-forth leading up to Election Day. As the country awaits the election results — a process officials around the country have signaled may take days, or even weeks, to conclude — Biden will await the count, himself, from his hometown Wilmington, Delaware. “Every moment of the last four years comes down to today,” he said on Tuesday, teeing up the close to a dramatic chapter in American history, as well as his own life's long journey to lead the White House. As America waits, here are some of the biggest moments that led Biden to the 2020 presidential election. Biden announced his presidential bid last April, immediately framing the race as a national ultimatum. Trump would “forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation” if re-elected to four more years in office, Biden said. In his three-minutevideo, Biden cast off a career-defining presidential run he immediately framed as more an American moral dilemma than an election decided by policy, calling out his eventual Republican opponent for his inflammatory rhetoric and stances on the country’s historic struggles with racial inequality. But before he took on Trump, the eventual Democratic presidential nominee faced a historically large field of inter-party competitors who gave the former vice president a tough — and unexpected — competition in the primaries. Running on a shifting political landscape, Biden stumbled out of the gate in the primary election. Biden, long presumed by pundits to be the Democratic nominee, fell to fourth place in the Iowa caucus and fifth place in the New Hampshire primary. Then, Biden pulled off a statement victory in South Carolina, leading to some of his most prominent competitors dropping out and backing his campaign, as he faced off against a final, and more liberal opponent, in Sen. Bernie Sanders. It wasn’t until\"Super Tuesday\", in early March, when Biden first overtook Sanders in the race, winning 10 of the 14 states and never looking back. “We were told when we got to ‘Super Tuesday’ that it was going to be over,” Biden said, turning his sights to the general election. “I’m here to report: We are very much alive. And make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.” Biden’s difficulty wrapping up the primary race wasn’t his only struggle early on, as he faced scrutiny over his past record from Democratic opponents. In one primary debate moment still in the back of the minds of some liberal voters, Biden shared an emotional exchange about race with his eventual running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris. The California senator called out Biden for what she described as his previous stance in the 1970s, opposing mandatory school busing legislation. (Biden later clarified that he opposed specific types of school busing requirements after the debate,accordingtoThe Washington Post.) Racial injustice and representation were defining factors of Biden’s 2020 campaign, leading him to name Harris, 56, as his running mate in the wake of George Floyd’s killing in police custody in Minneapolis. The August nomination was historic, as Harris becamethe first Black woman and the first person of Asian descentto be named to a major party’s ticket. It was also a deeply personal decision, Biden said, as Harris was a friend of his late son, Beau, a former Delaware attorney general who died of brain cancer in 2015. \"I watched as they took on the big banks, lifted up working people, and protected women and kids from abuse,\" Biden said of Beau and Harris. \"I was proud then, and I'm proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.\" Biden’s personal and family life became one of his biggest weaknesses, however. The Trump campaign latched onto a number of allegations and unverified accusations against the former vice president and hisembattledson Hunter, accusing the Democratic nominee of sexual assault and his son of corruption. The first accusation came from Biden's former Senate aideTara Reade, who accused the longtime lawmaker of assaulting her in the mid-1990s. (Biden, his campaign and some former co-workers have all disputed Reade’s claims, though Trump’s campaign pressed the issue throughout early 2020.) Then, weeks out from the Nov. 3 election, the Trump campaign, trailing in most national polls, pushed a previously disproven conspiracy theory that alleged Biden had been corruptly involved with son Hunter's overseas business dealings while he was vice president. Biden denied the allegations, which were pushed by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and reported — though, unverified, byTheNew York Post. (Trump's push to reveal some kind of corruption from Biden's past had previously led to his impeachment after he pushed Ukrainian officials to look into the conspiracy in 2019.) Separately, Giuliani helped disseminate uncorroborated material he said underscored Hunter's personal problems, such as a history of drug abuse. There was maybe no wonder why the president was grasping for dirt on his opponent, as he faced mounting criticism over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of Nov. 3,more than 232,000 Americans have diedfrom the novel coronavirus, which Trump admittedly downplayed as he complained throughout the year over how the global health crisis was affecting the economy. The pandemic upended the race, forcing Biden to largely remain quarantined at home like most Americans in the first half of 2020, before resuming a reserved campaign schedule under strict social distancing guidelines. Trump, ignoring his own health officials’ advice, continued holding large rallies and eventuallywound up in the hospitalhimself with the virus. Meanwhile, he sewed doubt on mail-in voting — which saw widespread increase in use due to health concerns about voting in person — and refused to agree to peacefully hand over power if Biden wins. “This is a life-changing election,\" Biden said upon receiving the party’s nomination in August, bringing the message of his campaign full circle. \"This will determine what America is going to look like for a long, long time.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Larry Dixon, a longtime Alabama state lawmaker who retired in 2010, died at 78 shortly after telling wife Gaynell to “please tell everybody to be careful,” Dixon’s friend Dr. David Thrasher tells PEOPLE. Thrasher, a local pulmonologist, says Gaynell shared her husband’s final words and gave the doctor her blessing to spread the message. “'I slipped up, I made a mistake,' \" Thrasher says Dixon had told his wife after contracting the virus at what the doctor says was \"a small gathering\" weeks ago while outdoors with friends. Four others tested positive in connection with that gathering, including Dixon's wife. Gaynell has \"turned the corner,\" according to Thrasher, who says the Dixons' daughters Elizabeth and Catherine are caring for their mother at their Montgomery home.

Dixon’s career in local government stretches back to 1975, when he was a Montgomery City Council member. “He devoted his life to service to this great city,” Perry Hooper, a former state representative and current member of the Republican State Executive Committee,wrote in an Alabama Daily News op-ed, adding that he was “still in shock” over Dixon’s death. “Larry, although not a Montgomery native, loved his adopted hometown as much as anyone. He devoted his life to service to this great city,” Hooper wrote. “He was a great legislator, a man of great moral character, and a devoted and loving husband and father.” RELATED:Olympic Gold Medalist Arnie Robinson Jr. Dead at 72 After Contracting COVID-19 Dixon was also the chairman of the Alabama State Board of Medical Examiners for 35 years, from 1981 until his retirement in 2016. “We are forever grateful for his distinguished service to the medical profession and to the State of Alabama,” the board wrote in astatement. “He set an incredible example of service for us all.” Thrasher tells PEOPLE that Dixon had taken the virus and social distancing precautions seriously throughout the pandemic, wearing a mask and abiding by local guidelines.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: A Florida jury could not reach a verdict on a female suspect's guilt or innocence, so a mistrial was declared in her case A Florida jury has convicted the man accused of killing popular law professor Dan Markel in 2014 — but jurors could not reach a verdict for a female suspect who was also on trial. According toThe Tallahassee Democrat, jurors found Sigfredo Garcia guilty of first-degree murder on Friday a little before 3 p.m. They continued to deliberate on suspect Katherine Magbanua’s guilt or innocence, but they could not reach a verdict, so a mistrial was declared in her case. Magbanua is the mother of Garcia’s two kids. She will stay in jail until she is re-tried,The Democratreports. Garcia could face the death penalty for Markel’s murder. His sentencing begins on Monday. Another man, gang leaderLuis Rivera, is already in prison for his role in Markel’s killing after pleading guilty and testifying against the other two. Garciafired two bullets at Markel’s head as he sat in his Honda Accord in the garage of his home July 18, 2014, shortly after Markel dropped off his two young sons at day care.Magbanuawas accused of being the go-between who set up the alleged murder by Garcia and Rivera. Garcia and Magbanua pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder. Rivera received a seven-year prison sentence for second-degree murder and was a key witness after telling authorities that he, Garcia and Magbanua allegedly split a $100,000 payment for killing Markel. At the time the nationally known professor Markel was killed, he and ex-wife Wendi Adelson were engaged in apost-divorce battle over their sons, Ben and Lincoln, then ages 3 and 4. Markel had gone to court to successfully block Adelson’s move with the boys from Tallahassee to South Florida, where her family lived, after the divorce sought by Adelson was granted in July 2013. Markel was murdered while waiting for a hearing to be set on his motion to limit the boys’ contact with Adelson’s mother, Donna, whom he claimed had “made disparaging remarks about him to his sons,” according to a 2016 probable cause affidavit obtained by PEOPLE. “Investigators believe motive for this murder stemmed from the desperate desire of the Adelson family to relocate Wendi and the children to South Florida, along with the pending court hearing that might have impacted their access to the grandchildren,” the affidavit states. RELATED:5 Things to Know About the Mysterious Shooting of Popular Florida Law Professor Dan Markel It adds: “Email evidence indicates Wendi’s parents, especially her mother, wanted Wendi to coerce Markel into allowing the relocation to South Florida. Additionally, Wendi’s brother Charles reportedly did not like Markel and did not get along with him.” The alleged link tying the Adelsons to the accused killers was first revealed in that same affidavit, in which investigators said Adelson’s brother, Charlie Adelson, “was involved in a personal relationship” with Magbanua, who is the mother of Garcia’s children and was described as a business associate of Garcia’s. Two weeks before Markel was killed, Magbanua and Charlie had been together in Key West, Florida, according to phone records, Detective Isom testified in 2016. Police say cell phone data, ATM records and a Tallahassee eyewitness allegedly tie Garcia and Rivera to the case. And Garcia’s first call after the murder was to Magbanua, they said. As the two men drove back to South Florida from Tallahassee on the day of the shooting, Garcia told Magbanua over the phone, “It’s done,” Isom testified, adding: “Once he had uttered the words, ‘It’s done,’ she replied with, ‘I know.’ “ Attorneys for the Adelson family swiftly dismissed speculation about the family’s involvement as“fanciful fiction,” adding in a joint statement, “To be clear, none of the Adelsons – Wendi, her brother Charlie, or their parents Donna and Harvey – had anything to do with Dan’s murder.” In 2016, then-State Attorney William Meggs pointedly declined to charge Charlie Adelson or any others in the family, telling theTallahassee Democrat: “We kind of believe they were involved according to the police. But what we believe and what we think doesn’t count. What evidence do we have?”Police have said the investigation into Markel’s murder is continuing. RELATED:Ex-Wife of Murdered Florida Law Professor, Whose Family Police Have Tied to His Death: ‘This is My Side of the Story’ “Five years ago Dan was murdered in cold blood outside his home — only hours after saying goodbye to his two young boys for what would be the last time,” attorney Orin Snyder, representing Ruth and Phil Markel, said in a statement to PEOPLE on the murder’s July 18 anniversary. “Five years later, his friends and family are still waiting for all of his killers to be brought to justice.” “Now, as they prepare to return to Tallahassee for the trial of some of Dan’s alleged killers, they will be forced to re-live the nightmare of Dan’s murder all over again,” said the statement. “They are counting down the days until justice is done.” It added: “More than anything, the Markels want to reunite with their beloved grandsons — Dan’s young boys — whom they have not been allowed to see in more than three years.” A prior call by PEOPLE to Wendi Adelson’s attorney, John Lauro, was not immediately returned. Adelson left the FSU law school faculty in 2015 and most recently worked asexecutive director of the South Florida-based Immigration Partnership & Coalition Fund, although she is no longer listed on itswebsite. But in a statement to the Tallahassee Democrat through Lauro, Adelson said: “Our boys and I continue to mourn Danny’s loss for each day of the five long years since he was taken from us.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: \"It's a big world and I've been blessed with the opportunity to see it,\" Maeve once said. \"How could I not jump at the opportunity?\" In 2008, five years after he had first written to her asking about getting a job at the congressional office where she worked, David McKean and Maeve Kennedy Townsend were leaving Tiffany’s after selecting an engagement ring. But rather than wait for some future proposal, the future Mrs. McKean knew exactly what she wanted — and on her finger went that ring. “I said, ‘Maeve! This is the parking lot of the store. This is not what I planned,” DavidtoldThe New York Timesin 2009. “She said, ‘Just propose to me now.’ You can’t argue with that logic, so right there in the parking lot I told her I loved her and I wanted her to marry me.” A decade and three kids later, he wasleft to reel at her sudden absence: On Thursday afternoon, Maeve, 40, and the 8-year-old son she and David share went missing in a canoeing accident in the Chesapeake Bay, with family at her mom’s waterfront home in Shady Side, Maryland, not far away. The scene David described — later detailed in statements by local authorities — was of a mother and son who had set out unaware of the danger about to overtake them. Waves were two to three feet and the wind whipped at around 30 mph, the Coast GuardtoldThe Washington Post. RELATED:Looking Back at the Kennedy Family’s Tragedies Some of the kids that day at the family home had been playing with a ball that went into the water, and so Maeve and son Gideon “popped into a canoe to chase it down,” David, 38, told thePost. “They just got farther out than they could handle and couldn’t get back in,” he said. A 911 call came in about them at 4:30 p.m. From a pier not far from the home, “a concerned citizen …. stated he saw two people in a small canoe or kayak drifting in the bay,” according to the Anne Arundel County Fire Department. “Firefighters arrived at the pier and confirmed the sighting of two people in a small vessel several miles from the pier drifting south in the Chesapeake Bay,” the department said in a statement on Friday. Thursday at 7 p.m., a canoe and paddle were recovered. But the search was still underway on Friday for Maeve and Gideon. “At this time, our family asks for privacy and that everyone keep Maeve and Gideon in their prayers,” a family spokesman said in a statement to thePost. Here’s what you need to know about Maeve, a Kennedy granddaughter who has charted her own course on human rights and government service, following her mom, her grandfather and her great-uncles. “It’s a big world and I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to see it,” Maeveonce toldThe Baltimore Sunin those early years after she left college. “How could I not jump at the opportunity?” Maeve is the second daughter of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, an attorney and a former lieutenant governor of Maryland, and David Townsend, an attorney and professor and “incredibly supportive husband”who helped run the houseduring his wife’s time in office. Maeve and her three sisters — Meaghan, the eldest, and Kate and Kerry; both she and Meaghan were born at home — did not grow up with the same level of attention as other Kennedy children. This reflected some familial distance compared to, say, Caroline Kennedy and John F. Kennedy Jr., but it was also by design. “I’m trying to be protective of my children,” their mom told theSunin 2002. “They’re not in the limelight and I’m pretty comfortable with that.” Kathleen and David moved to Maryland from Massachusetts in the mid ’80s, where she embarked on a political career that eventually saw her elected lieutenant governor from 1995 to 2003. She also unsuccessfully campaigned to be Maryland’s top executive. “We’re a pretty normal family,” Maevetold thePostin 2002, “except my mom is running for governor.” The Townsend kids were raised, mostly, in Ruxton, north of Baltimore, according to theSun. “They attended a variety of schools, both public and private … and were active in local youth sports,” the paper reported in 2002. RELATED:‘Please Pray’ — Kennedy Family Speaks After RFK Granddaughter & Her Son Go Missing in Canoeing Accident Maeve, who graduated from Boston College, was “the enthusiastic, charismatic, passionate sibling,” with a penchant for well-written letters home, according to theSun. “She’s outgoing and makes friends easily,” Kathleen said then. As a girl, she was “always playful, a kind of Annie Oakley character,” her dadtoldThe New York Timesin 2009. After college, Maeve went on to the Peace Corps (famously founded by her great-uncle) where she taught “English and AIDS awareness to teen-agers in a rural village in Mozambique,” according to theSun. Later, while working in California Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office, she met the man who would become her husband. David, two years Maeve’s junior, wrote her a letter in 2003 before his final year at college as part of his hunt for a summer internship. “Dear Ms. Townsend,” he called her, according to theTimes. He got a job, and they grew closer. To her, he was “funny and very handsome,” and he thought she was “so cute and really fun and bubbly.” While David initially had a girlfriend, his bond with Maeve persisted, according to aTimeswrite-up of their eventual nuptials. He went back to San Diego the next summer, where he had first worked in Sen. Feinstein’s office, and he and Maeve began dating. ”They’re like bubbles in a nice glass of Champagne,” a friend told theTimes. ”They pop like that.” Kennedy matriarch Ethel Kennedy was similarly gushing to the paper, saying in 2009, ”It’s a real joy to be around them. They bounce off each other.” SpeakingwithGlamourin 2008, Maeve recalled: “Four years ago … I met a UC Berkeley lit major named Dave McKean, who was kind, brilliant and hilarious. He went off to the Far East to teach English just when I was moving to Washington. At the end of his school year, I bought a plane ticket to China, and we traveled through Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos. You really get to know each other when you both have food poisoning in Cambodia.” “Now I’m at Georgetown, getting both a law degree and international relations M.A., he’s at American U. law school, and we are head over heels in love,” she continued then, playfully noting: “Like Brangelina, we sometimes sign our letters ‘Maevid.’ He just asked me to marry him!” They were married on March 21, 2009, by Judge James H. Wexler, a family friend, theTimesreported. Maeve wore “sparkly sneakers” with her strapless gown. Eight-year-old son Gideon — now missing with his mom — was their first child, named for a Supreme Court decisionaccording to thePost. She and David reportedly have two other kids: daughter Gabriella and son Toby, the youngest. Maeve most recently has been serving as the executive director of Georgetown’s Global Health Initiative, a “university-wide platform for supporting research, teaching, and service in global health.” She is a Georgetown alumnae, having earned both her law degree and a master’s degree in international negotiations and conflict resolution in 2009. “Her work focuses on the intersection of global health and human rights,” according to abrief Georgetown bio. Before that, she worked in the State Department’s global AIDS program under former PresidentBarack Obamaas well as in the Department of Health and Human Services focusing on human rights, according to thePost. David, who attended American University’s law school, is also a human rights attorney who has worked for the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, per thePost. Reflecting on her family name, Maeve toldGlamourin 2008 that people were quick to misunderstand her lot in life. “People think, because I’m a Kennedy, I’m extremely wealthy and don’t flaunt it,” she said with a laugh. “I have a great name, but by the time you get to the fourth generation, the money’s run out. We’re fortunate compared to the average American, but to think I’m a trust fund kid — so not true!” Only two generations removed from America’s most famous trio of political scions — former PresidentJohn F. Kennedyand Sens.TedandRobert Kennedy— Maeve toldGlamourthat she had her own civic goals. “There’s no question that I want to go into public service, but my friends and I talk a lot about the question, How can you go into public service with debts like the ones we’re racking up?” she said then. “I’ll be leaving law school with $150,000 in student loans to repay. Human rights jobs have starting salaries of $35,000. It’s up to us to find a way to keep doing good while going into our chosen careers.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

As she enters a new chapter on television, Bartiromo is determined to continue sharing her encyclopedic knowledge of the markets from her home studio, especially for this year's high school graduates, who are entering what some are calling one of the worst job markets in modern history. \"The truth is the class of 2020 is facing a very difficult moment in time, but at the same time, learning a hard lesson right out of the gate that you have to adapt to what's thrown at you and deal with the reality of the situation,\" says Bartiromo, fresh from delivering Iona College's commencement speech earlier this month. However, Bartiromo still believes \"there are plenty of opportunities now for the class of 2020, given the fact that we are seeing the digital economy accelerate telehealth and tele-education, buying online and deliveries.\" Her No. 1 advice for graduates? \"Know what you're good at, love what you do, work hard because there are no shortcuts and always do the right thing,\" she tells PEOPLE over the phone. \"Because no matter what happens to you in the future, whatever industry it is or geography, you will always understand that your reputation is the one thing that will always follow you. So you need to cherish it and protect it.\" RELATED:7 Ridiculously Easy Ways to Save Money While Shopping Online Read on for more of Bartiromo's financial insight and answers to some of everyday folks' most pressing financial questions during the pandemic. When will the economy bounce back? Bartiromo doesn't \"want to paint too rosy a picture,\" but she's optimistic. \"I think that we will see a comeback in the economy — I don't think it will be an immediate snapback,\" she says. \"I think we're going to have a second half that is certainly much better than the first half. I interviewed President Trump [earlier this month], and the president called the third quarter a transition to greatness, and I do see the third quarter as somewhat of a transition. I think we will see growth in the third quarter as businesses continue to open. Today, we've got all 50 states havingsome kind of a reopening, whether it's partial or all, and so this is going to take time, but by the third quarter you will see that transition to growth. And then in the fourth quarter, you will see more growth. And I think in 2021, we'll continue to see more of a rebound.\" What are people asking you for advice on — and what do you say? \"People are worried when money gets tight, right? Here we are all living at home, working from home,\" says Bartiromo. \"Certain companies will not be able to avoid layoffs. People are thinking, 'How am I going to pay the rent? How am I going to keep up with my expenses?' This is one of those moments in time where if you were creating a cushion for yourself leading up to this, you are in a better position.\" If you haven't created a cushion, Bartiromo says now is the time to start using her three-bucket system. \"One bucket is your retirement money, and that you can do very easily,\" says Bartiromo. \"If you work for a company that has a 401(k) plan, boom, you've got to join it ASAP, and then that's free money because your company will match that. That's retirement money that you're not touching at all until you retire.\" \"Your second bucket is going to be the bucket of savings for things that you want to save for,\" adds Bartiromo, pointing to goals like purchasing a home or paying for your child's college education and your daughter's wedding. \"Whatever it is, you've got that savings that your money is earmarked for.\" The third and final bucket is for your operating expenses. \"This is the bucket that your check will go in, and you're going to pay [bills] out of that bucket,\" says Bartiromo. \"If you're lucky enough to have more as you continue to fill up these buckets, you want to also create another bucket, which is a bucket of your fun money. If you want to go on a trip, you want to get yourself a gift, you want to fix up your kitchen — you have that extra money in another bucket.\" Of course, many dreams might be further off now — and the funds in your buckets can be put to use to sustain yourself. \"If you are thrown a curveball like what we have, you have those buckets to rely on,\" says Bartiromo. \"You know that, ‘Okay, well, I have this cushion, I was saving this for my house, a country home someday. But you know what? I'm going to be tapping into that now.' I think that it's very important to understand how to earmark certain important things in your life and put some money away for them in their own bucket, because then you safeguard yourself from unknowns, like the one we’re in right now.\" What if someone has been laid off and has no savings? \"The first thing you always have to do is take a look at the expense side of the ledger,\" says Bartiromo. \"What are you spending your money on? Start doing an assessment of your own personal balance sheet and income statement. You're going to have to start identifying places to pull back. What does any company do when you're in a situation where business just slowed down? They start cutting costs. The individual needs to take on that same narrative, that same process of looking at where I can cut. Oftentimes, we are spending money that we don't even realize we're spending, and we're overspending on things. I bet you're going to be able to take out a lot of costs on just step one.\" \"Step two is you have to try to manage your income differently,\" she continues. \"If you feel that you can have an opportunity to work from home and gain income from it, look for those opportunities. Obviously you want to get that stimulus check. When you get that stimulus check, don't blow it. Try to have it grow. Maybe, if you can, put some of it in one of your buckets. That's what you should be doing — not spending it, but putting half of it in some of your buckets that we talked about earlier. If you can put a portion of it in an investment account to try to build on it, that's not a bad idea either. But of course, it is probably going to your bills.\" For people looking for new jobs or career shifts, which industries should they consider? Bartiromo emphasizes the \"industries that may be poised to open faster\" and show growth. \"I would say construction,\" she says. \"I was on my bike the other day. There’s a lot of construction happening, and this is an industry that you can do while social distancing. Technology, telehealth, tele-education, online [retail], deliveries — those will all persist when we get out of this, in my view. They will also be the likely job creators over the near term.\" Is it a smart move to take advantage of the CARES Act and move money out of your 401(k)? \"If you can avoid it, I would,\" says Bartiromo, who acknowledges that it's tempting to rely on 401(k) funds after Congress' CARES Act made it possible for employees to withdraw a maximum of $100,000 in hardship distributions while avoiding the steep 10% early withdrawal cost. \"If you can't avoid it, the government is giving you the opportunity that you won't get penalized,\" she adds. \"But it's really money that is put away for when you truly need it in retirement.\" RELATED:The Best Money Lessons for Kids of All Ages, Whether Just Starting Chores or Facing College Debt Alternatively, let's say you want to ramp up your 401(k) contributions. Is now a good time to do that? \"Yes, it is, absolutely,\" says Bartiromo. \"In fact, the government is giving you as much leeway to make moves right now. I would put as much as you can in 401(k) if you can afford it. If it's actually cutting into your household bills and any other expenses that you have, then now is not the time to do that, but I'm always of the belief that you want to really take advantage of that 401(k) because your company is matching it. The younger you are, the more you want to just get in the habit of the money directly going in there, so that you don't even see the money. Because at some point when you do retire, you're going to have a nice nest egg and you're going to be able to live the way you want to and the way you were living when you had a steady income.\" Many Americans have big deposits and/or payments due on things that they're not sure will even happen, such as school tuition in the fall. How would you approach that situation? \"Right now, universities are trying to work with families on this very issue,\" Bartiromo points out. \"People are unsure if their child is going to go and live on campus, if they're going to have to continue home learning. So we're learning more and more about this, but certainly at a minimum, if you are a parent with a child at a university and you are looking at these additional bills coming at you, you need to call the university. They are actually dealing with this right now and putting plans in place to either say, ‘Okay, let's put this off, and your child can start in the January semester.' There are a lot of schools right now thinking about continuing in the fall semester online and then ramping up in January. So it depends on where you're located, which university you're talking about, but you certainly should be engaging with the university personnel right now.\" Is now a good time to refinance your mortgage? \"You're not going to get a better time to refinance, frankly,\" says Bartiromo. \"Right now rates are at such rock-bottom levels, and Jay Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, testified that we likely see rates at these levels or around these levels until 2023. However, as the economy continues to open, as things get a little stronger — as they will and we are expecting going into the third and fourth quarter — rates will bounce off of the bottom, but I'm not expecting a substantial change or spike in any way, shape or form anytime soon. So now would be the time, if you have the cash and the interest, to actually look at new homes or refinance your current home. You’re getting close to free money here. You're borrowing at such low levels. I don't know that you're going to see another time like this after we get out of this period for a long time.\" If someone is considering moving away from a big city because of the pandemic, is now a bad time to sell a home? \"It depends on the market, certainly,\" begins Bartiromo. \"But I do think that you're hitting your finger on something that is sort of hidden in plain sight, and I think that is the pressure that we're going to see on cities. Increasingly, as we learn more about working from home, about the vulnerabilities that we could find ourselves in being in crowded places, people are increasingly trying to avoid cities — big cities and density. I do think you're going to have a situation where cities will face a bigger strain than the boroughs and the suburbs. Sometimes that works for that person wanting to go to the city, so I suspect real estate prices will come down in cities. I suspect we could see tighter budgets in cities, and that will mean that city services will be strained.\" \"Selling your home right now? I think prices have come down quite a bit and there are a lot of people who expect prices to continue to come down, but it really is the area that you're referring to,\" Bartiromo continues. \"The very, very, very high end has come down, but the middle-high end is actually still moving. Cities are seeing prices go down for sure, because people are fleeing cities. And by the way, they were fleeing cities before COVID-19.\" What advice would you give someone whose income has gone up because of the federal government's $600 per week increase to unemployment benefits? \"I would put it in a savings bucket, because right now you're seeing a situation where some individuals are making more money by staying home than they're actually making by going to work,\" says Bartiromo. \"And that could be a false sense of security. Don't kid yourself. This [unemployment] program will end. Right now it's scheduled to end on July 31. If the economy starts opening now in May, in June, and you're starting to see some temporary opportunities out there to get back into it, I would do that and not be complacent about this because once you get to July 31, you don't know if those opportunities are still going to be there. What you want to do is, if you are lucky enough to have more money than you thought you would, I would 100% put as much as you can into one of those buckets that you've been saving — maybe your operating account, where you're paying bills, maybe the savings account where you're saving for your wedding. Just put it away, and then you know that it's not going to get cut down.\" How will working from home during the pandemic impact industries? \"Across business, people are rethinking the way they're doing things,\" she says. \"And I think that if it works, then it may very well become something more sustainable later because I think managers today are recognizing new threats. It’s about confidence coming back — it's all about confidence, and people have to have confidence to go to a crowded restaurant, but workers also have to have confidence to go into their high-rise buildings, touch the elevator button and know that they're going to get back to life the way it was. In many corners, the confidence won't be there in that regard for a while. As a result, I think companies are thinking, well, let's see what we can accommodate for the home. Let's see how far we can push it and how much cost this could actually save. Yes, I do think we will see increasing trends working from home, whether it be a show or certainly other industries that are much more poised and adaptable to working at home.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

On Monday, Floyd's May 25 death will take center stage again as the since-fired officer,Derek Chauvin, goes to trial in a Minneapolis courtroom on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Three other now-former officers on the scene -- Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng -- will be tried later this summer on charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter. All have pleaded not guilty. But the very public incident, which unfolded as George was being detained for allegedly spending a counterfeit $20 bill, still remains a very personally felt loss for LaTonya, 52, an upholsterer in Houston, and others in the Floyd family. \"He called me 'Chief,'\" says LaTonya, who called him \"Floyd.\" \"We were close. We just laughed. That was my best friend.\" \"I miss him every day,\" she says. RELATED:Joe Biden Speaks Out on George Floyd's Death, Issues Executive Orders to Address Racial Inequality George, 46, had three brothers and three sisters, several of whom banded together to launch theGeorge Floyd Memorial Foundationwith the stated mission \"to promote global awareness of racial injustices and provide opportunities for others to contribute to the unification of our communities.\" His sister Bridgett Floyd, 30, is the foundation's president and chairwoman. \"His legacy is his spirit, his personality, his character, who he was,\" Bridgett says of her brother. \"And the person that he was, we will fulfill and keep that forever alive.\" The foundation aims to provide college scholarships and created an internship program at George's alma mater, Texas A&M University-Commerce, in his name. It also supports a recently renewed effort in Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which would ban chokeholds by federal law enforcement and create a national registry maintained by the Justice Department to document police misconduct. \"I had no idea that my brother would be someone that could make history,\" says Bridgett. \"I'm talking about, like, a Martin Luther King history. That's deep for me to wake up to every day.\" RELATED:Beyoncé, Kerry Washington and More Remember George Floyd on What Would've Been His 47th Birthday She also recognized him -- and found comfort -- in the oft-told tales of her brother's kindnesses, following his past struggles with addiction and time spent in prison for armed robbery. \"If you don't have a past, you can't learn,\" she says. \"My brother went out and spoke to kids on the block, took kids to get baptized, did speaking engagements at basketball, at the gyms. He had already been down a road that he didn't want to go down anymore, and when he saw kids on he block making the craziest decisions, he felt like he needed to do something about it. That's just who he was.\" Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Within the extended family, George had sway as well. \"He wouldn't allow people to go on without talking for long periods of time. If anything needed to be nipped in the bud, he was the pusher,\" says Bridgett. \"I've learned that we don't have that family mediator to bridge the gap between us sometimes any more, and without him being here, you can really tell.\" A former healthcare worker, she is now a speaker and activist in her brother's name. \"I wasn't prepared for this,\" she says, \"but God had other plans.\" \"This has been very hard for me, but I get up every day and I put my boots on and I do anything I can to keep my brother's name alive, because I know he would do it for me,\" she says.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: With her exit from office, Connecticut state Sen. Alex Kasser is spotlighting a messy split from husband Seth Bergstein, a prominent banking executive A Connecticut state lawmaker said this week she was leaving office amid a contentious divorce from her husband and that it was \"too painful\" to keep living in the area she represents.State Sen. Alex Kasser, who changed her last name from Bergstein in February, said in astatementTuesday that \"it is with deep sadness\" that she was announcing her resignation.Kasser, 54, had represented the state's 36th district, which includes Greenwich and portions of New Canaan and Stamford. She was the first Democrat to win the district since 1930, upsetting a five-term Republican for the seat in 2018. With her exit from office, Kasser is spotlighting a messy split from husband Seth Bergstein, a prominent banking executive. She claims the years-long divorce was fueled by her coming out as gay and him refusing to let her leave though he calls her version a \"fabricated narrative\" and noted that their kids chose to live with him. The couple married in 1995 and have three now-grown children together,accordingto the Associated Press.\"For nearly three years, I've been trying to divorce Seth Bergstein,\" Kasser said in her statement Tuesday, which also claimed she had been \"trapped in an abusive situation\" by Bergstein, 55 - an allegation he vehemently denied. She said in her statement she was proud of her own work advancing legislation supporting abuse survivors. \"As all survivors of domestic abuse know, emancipating ourselves is an epic struggle that takes years, requires unflinching courage and all our resources - mental, physical, and financial,\" she said. RELATED:'We'll All Be Dead by June': Scenes from Trump's COVID and George Floyd Response, According to New Books Kasser claimed her husband \"uses his powerful position at Morgan Stanley to enable his conduct\" and that she's fighting for their divorce to be finalized.\"Because of the enormous time and energy this consumes, I can no longer serve my constituents to my fullest ability,\" she said. In aneditorialin October, Kasser wrote that \"ten years ago I told my husband I was gay and asked for a divorce,\" which she said he did not accept. Instead, she claimed, he threatened he would \"take full custody of our kids and use my sexuality against me in court,\" and so she stayed in their marriage for eight more years.Janet A. Battey, a divorce lawyer representing Bergstein, told the AP this week that Kasser's allegations were \"outrageous\" and \"couldn't be further from the truth.\" Bergstein is a top executive at Morgan Stanley, leading the New York City investment banks' global services department and working as the company's managing director. He has spent his entire career at the company, since taking a job as a financial analyst in 1988. Battey, his attorney, tells PEOPLE that his \"priority is the wellbeing of his three children - all of whom have chosen to reside with him - and he is not going to disparage their mother in a public forum or engage in a detailed response to her fabricated narrative.\" \"Any suggestion of abuse is untrue,\" Battey says. \"He trusts that the legal process and the court are the appropriate forum for their divorce to be resolved and finalized.\" RELATED:Kerstin Emhoff Opens Up About Doug, Kamala and Why She's Not Just 'the Famous Ex-Wife' A review of the court docket suggests intense legal maneuvering in the couple's divorce case: There have been more than 200 filings since 2018, when the case began. The latest filing came Tuesday, the same day Kasser notified the state she had resigned. The court docket shows Kasser has hired attorney Robert Cohen, who is also representingMelinda Gatesin her divorce fromBill Gates. Cohen previously representedIvana TrumpandMarla Maplesduring their divorces from former PresidentDonald Trump, according toCNBC. Kasser alleged in her resignation statement that her partner, Nichola Samponaro, who is her former campaign manager, has also been targeted by \"lies ... and harassing court motions\" from Bergstein. \"She had nothing to do with ending my marriage,\" Kasser said.She said that in addition to leaving office, she would be leaving the Greenwich area she represented \"as it is loaded with memories of the 20 years I spent raising my children here.\"\"It is too painful to be in Greenwich now that I've been erased from their lives, just as their father promised would happen if I ever left him,\" she said.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: When Doug Oliver nearly crashed into two pedestrians on a crosswalk, and then turned the corner and nearly hit another, a police officer stopped him. In the passenger seat was Oliver’s hysterical wife. Oliver clearly hadn’t seen the pedestrians at all. The officer gave him two choices: go to the eye doctor or hand over your license. He chose the former. “The doctor wrote in my chart in great big letters, ‘NO MORE DRIVING’ ” Oliver tells PEOPLE of the 2007 incident. “At 45, I was legally blind. I went into shock.” A rare genetic form ofMacular Degeneration, a diagnosis he’d received 13 years prior, before symptoms occurred, had now caused blind spots in his central vision and no peripheral vision. There is no approved treatment. He lost his job as a computer programmer in rural New Hampshire and his marriage failed. Oliver moved to Nashville to retire and live out his years on disability payments. He met Ann Coble, who teaches theology, on an online dating site and scheduled a ride with a public transit service for the disabled to take her to dinner. Despite watching him fall off the curb and the fact that he could barely read and could only see the features on half of her face, the couple married four years ago. A constant search for research studies onclinicaltrials.goveventually landed Oliver in the Stem Cell Ophthalmology Treatment Study (SCOTS), with Dr. Jeffrey Weiss and Dr. Steven Levy and in Coconut Creek, Florida. Since 2013, the retinal surgeons have treated 400 patients suffering from 47 different optic nerve and retinal conditions, all of whom had exhausted every other treatment available to them. More than 400 patients have participated and 60 percent have improved, Levy says. For some conditions, the success rate has been 89 percent. “I spoke with my own retinal specialist and asked what the chances were that a treatment or cure would come in time for me to enjoy it,” Oliver says. “He said the chance was zero.” Oliver knew the FDA did not consider the stem cell therapy a proven treatment, but he was willing to take the risk. In August 2015 — in just over an hour — an orthopedic surgeon extracted Oliver’s bone marrow from his hip with a needle, a machine separated out the stem cells and Weiss injected the stem cells into both retinas. The very next day, his peripheral vision was restored, and as Ann drove him to the doctor, he giddily reported that he could see her pulling her hair back. He and the clinic technician both cried when Oliver excelled at a Amsler Grid macular degeneration vision test. By December, he could see well enough to drive, though he had to learn to drive again with a learner’s permit first since he hadn’t been behind the wheel in 10 years. “I can read, I can run, I can fix things around the house,” he says. The ability to see people’s lips when they talk has also improved his hearing. Though he has some lingering blind spots, “My vision is restored to the level I had 20 years ago,” he says. While the stem cells are his own, eliminating the possibility of rejection, they do have his DNA with the hereditary disease, so in a number of years his vision may deteriorate again. “This is a treatment, not a cure,” he says. He no longer wears embarrassing custom prism and telescopic glasses, but for distance and reading he continues to need “regular glasses,” he says. Oliver spent $21,000 for treatment, raising some of the money with a GoFundMe campaign. He also spent some $4,000 for travel to get to the doctors and stay in Florida for the week. He has now set up Regenerative Outcomes Foundation to assist other people with ancillary expenses. Tennessee Senator Lamar Alexander was taken with Oliver’s story and invited him to Washington, D.C., to address staff on the Senate Health Committee and meet with members of Congress as they worked on new legislation. Particularly important to patients is a faster FDA process so that these potential treatments and cures will be covered by health insurance. As President Obama prepared to leave the White House, he signed the $6.3 billion 21stCentury Cures Act in December, spurring game-changing medical breakthroughs, including the stem cell treatment that Oliver received as well as improved treatments and outright cures for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, precision medicine and regenerative medicine. Cutting edge researchers across the country already report some success in trials. Advances in imaging technology are a great asset to Dr. Jeffrey Cummings at the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas, as he can now detect the Alzheimer’s protein before symptoms occur. “We hope we can keep them functioning at a normal level and they will never develop symptoms,” he says. Parents of young children diagnosed with autism and cerebral palsy who banked their children’s cord blood have been participating in preliminary but promising studies by Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg at Duke University. Given one 15-minute infusion followed by fluid, more than 70 percent of children in the autism study showed improvement. Children with cerebral palsy who could only walk with a walker or couldn’t walk at all are walking on their own a year or two after the treatment. “We do have a lot of very grateful parents,” Kurtzberg says. Heart failure patients have seen significant improvement in a study at Texas Heart Institute where healthy adult donor stem cells are injected into a patient’s left ventricle to induce the heart muscle to repair itself. “This has the potential to be transformative for those with the most severe coronary heart disease and heart failure,” says Dr. Emerson C. Perin. Hope is high for millions more patients and their families. Passage of the Cures Act was a rare bipartisan effort that made strange bedfellows of Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is a polio-survivor, and Democrats, headed by then-Vice President Joe Biden, who lost his oldest son Beau to brain cancer at age 46 in 2015. Oliver says legislators, who voted nearly unanimously in favor of the bill, kept asking the same question: Could their own family members be helped? At a celebration of the law’s passage, Oliver proudly presented Sen. Alexander with his white cane. “I don’t need it any more,” he says.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The policy, which will take effect in 30 days, does not apply to menthol and tobacco-flavored products The Food and Drug Administration has announced a new policy to limit the access young people have tovaping productsin the United States. On Thursday, the FDA announced that starting in 30 days, they would begin enforcing a ruleprohibiting sales of “flavored, cartridge-based” e-cigarette products— which includes fruit and mint flavors — with the exception of tobacco and menthol. The policy will also apply to vaping products specifically “targeted to minors or whose marketing is likely to promote use” by children. Companies that do not stop selling, manufacturing or producing the products will risk enforcement actions from the FDA. In November, findings from the2019 National Youth Tobacco Surveyshowed that over 5 million middle and high school-aged children use e-cigarettes, with the majority of respondents indicating a preference for cartridge-based products. RELATED:How to Talk to Your Kids About Vaping — Two Pulmonologists Give Facts and Tips “The United States has never seen an epidemic of substance use arise as quickly as our current epidemic of youth use of e-cigarettes,” Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in astatement. “By prioritizing enforcement against the products that are most widely used by children, our action today seeks to strike the right public health balance by maintaining e-cigarettes as a potential off-ramp for adults using combustible tobacco while ensuring these products don’t provide an on-ramp to nicotine addiction for our youth,” Azar continued. “We will not stand idly by as this crisis among America’s youth grows and evolves, and we will continue monitoring the situation and take further actions as necessary.” Added FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D: “While we expect that responsible members of industry will comply with premarket requirements, we’re ready to take action against any unauthorized e-cigarette products as outlined in our priorities. We’ll also closely monitor the use rates of all e-cigarette products and take additional steps to address youth use as necessary.” The FDA also declined to refer to the policy as a “ban,” noting that companies wishing to sell such products can “submit an application” and the federal agency will decide whether to authorize the products for sale. RELATED VIDEO: Teen’s Lung and Kidneys Destroyed by Vaping Illness Explaining why the FDA continued to permit the sale of tobacco and menthol flavors, Azar told reports on Thursday that the flavors were “less appealing” to kids, according to CNBC. Juul, a popular e-cigarette manufacturer, previously announced they wouldstop sellingtheir mint-flavored pods shortly after studies listed the flavor as themost popular among high school students,the outlet reported. Months earlier,Donald Trumpannounced plans to undertake a more all-encompassing policy, which would completely remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market, with the exception of tobacco-flavored products. In December, Congress passed a year-end congressional spending bill with a provision toraise the purchasing age for all tobacco products— including cigarettes and e-cigarettes — from 18 to 21. Azar also made it clear on Thursday that the decision to prohibit sales of flavored-products is seen as a “separate issue” fromvaping-related lung illnessesby the Trump administration,CNBCreported.

Helmreich died on Saturday at his home in Great Neck, New York, his son Jeffreytold theNew York Times. His passing was confirmed byThe City College of New York, where Helmreich worked as a sociology professor prior to his death. “It’s my sad duty to tell you that Professor William Helmreich, distinguished professor and foundational member of the CCNY sociology department, has passed away, falling to the coronavirus,” CCNY President Vincent Boudreau said in a statement on Monday. “Willy—as everyone knew him—was an expansive writer and analyst, covering topics as varied as immigration, life inside yeshivas and the formation of stereotypes. He will, however, almost certainly be most fondly remembered for a joyful series of recent books, chronicling his efforts to walk all the streets of New York, and report on what he saw and heard.” RELATED: Celebrities We Lost to Coronavirus in 2020 He added, “News of his passing came today with virtually no forewarning—few among us even knew that he was sick—and so serves as an urgent reminder.

Do not believe that we are, any of us, made safe by anything except vigilance and care.” Born in Switzerland to Holocaust survivors, Helmreich immigrated to New York City as an infant and grew up in Manhattan’s Upper East Side. Inspired by a game he played with his father growing up, in which they would ride a subway line and explore the neighborhood where it stopped, Helmreich embarked on a four-year quest to walk every street in five boroughs of New York City and study its residents. His walks resulted in 2013’sThe New York Nobody Knows: Walking 6,000 Miles in the City, a book which chronicled his strolls and the people he met along the way.

Avocadomilk, a brand that sells several varieties of non-dairy milks made from freeze-dried avocados and oats, has anew vegan versionof its staple product, which will be hitting shelves in the United States next month. The new version will be almost the same as the original beverage, only the list of ingredients will no longer include honey, according toVegNews. “It was a very easy decision to make—our customers told us that they wanted a vegan product,” Terry Daly, President and CEO of Avo88 and Avocadomilk, told the outlet in a statement. “All we did was listen to them and we are over the moon with the new formulation. It tastes better, it’s healthier, it’s simply beautiful.” As for bringing the brand, which was originally just sold in New Zealand and Australia, to the states, Daly said that “it was an obvious” move. “On a trip to the US, I went into a Gelsens in LA and watched how the customers picked up the products and actually read the nutritional labels,” he said. “It was obvious to us that the US, and especially California, was setting the benchmark for the alternative milk category and we had to be here.” So what exactly is Avocadomilk? “It is a dairy free, preservative free, artificial colours and flavors free, cholesterol free, lactose free, vegetarian milk, that contains aminimum of 20% of the goodness of an avocado in every bottle,” according to the brand’s website. In addition to having some of the same nutrients inside actual avocados, the original version of the beverage is also green in color — just like the actual fruit. RELATED:Tiger-Themed Twinkies Filled with Orange Creme Are Coming to Walmart The drink, which has a shelf life of 11 months, also claims to be environmentally and socially responsible, as it uses “ugly” fruit — and pays growers “20% above market rate” for the products.

If green-colored milk is a little outside your comfort zone, Avocadomilk also makes a chocolate version, which is flavored with cacao — and only has 6 grams of sugar per cup.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The new show will be calledThe G Word with Adam Conover. While it is based on the nonfiction bestsellerThe Fifth Riskby Michael Lewis, which focused on the transition from Obama toDonald Trump, Netflix says the show will be a loose adaptation. A Netflix source downplays other headlines that it will be an Obama-supported Trump satire: \"It's more of a focus on going inside how the government actually works, not specific to any one administration.\" According to Netflix,The G Wordis backed by Higher Ground and Fair Point productions and will begin filming in early 2021. The Fifth Risk, an expansion of a 2017 article Lewis wrote forVanity Fair, details Trump-fueled mismanagement during the transition from the Obama presidency.

From the synopsis: \"The United States government affects our lives in countless ways, from the food we eat to the money in our bank accounts. But despite the many hours we spend obsessing over politics, almost none of us know the first thing about the massive organization those politicians are supposed to run. Instead, 'government' has become a dirty word that we'd rather not talk or even think about.\" According to the synopsis, host Conover will use \"fast-paced visual comedy\" and documentary to demonstrate \"the profound power and complexity of the U.S. government\" and show viewers \"the heroic civil servants who make it work\" while taking \"an incisive satirical look at its shortcomings.\" Conover, 37, is a comedian and the host of Nickelodeon’sThe Crystal Mazeas well as the host and creator of truTV'sAdam Ruins Everything. \"Very happy to finally be able to share this news: I'm creating a new comedy series for Netflix about the federal government,\" Conovertweetedin November. \"It's called The G Word, and I can't wait to share it with you.\" The Fifth Riskauthor Lewis, who also wroteMoneyballandThe Big Short, first broke the news that his book would be adapted into an Obama-produced show in an interview onKatie Couric's podcastin 2018. Explaining his rationale for writing the book, Lewis told Couric then that he wanted it to provide a \"civics lesson\" for society to better understand how government works. “The narrative needs to change first, that’s why I wrote the book … So people stop seeing the government as the problem and start seeing it as a tool, as a solution.

The Lt. Gov. published a letter from his doctor with further details about the condition and his overall health.

While Fetterman's word recognition and cognitive abilities are intact, and he hasn't lost any memory, he does sometimes struggle with hearing, he said in an interview with thePittsburgh Post-Gazetteat the time.

The lies about Obama, a Christian, and the Nativity scene recirculated around this same time last year, and similarclaimswere made nearly every year Obama was in office, according to Snopes. The misinformation goes hand-in-hand with the idea — often pushed by Fox News and other conservative outlets and pundits in recent years — that “liberals” like Obama are waging a“War on Christmas.” “People who believe Christmas is under attack point to inclusive phrases like ‘Happy Holidays’ as (liberal) insults to Christianity,”The New York Timessaid in a piece examining the phenomenon last December.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: “You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,\" New York's governor said on Tuesday As the number ofnovel coronavirus casesin New York continues to balloon, PresidentDonald Trumptold Fox News that he didn’t believe the state really needed the 30,000 ventilators it says will critically help treat what it expects may be an overwhelming amount of patients. “I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be,” Trump, 73,told Sean Hannity. “I don’t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,” the president said. “You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they’ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they’re saying, ‘Can we order 30,000 ventilators?’ ” He didn’t mention New York by name, but the suggestion was clear based on New York Gov.Andrew Cuomo‘s comments. “I hope NY doesn’t ultimately need 30,000 ventilators. But I don’t operate on opinion and hope. I operate on facts and data and science. All the projections say we will need 30,000-40,000 ventilators,” Cuomotweetedon Friday morning. “So that is what we will strive to have.” Also on Friday, Trumptweeted, without further evidence: “Thousand of Federal Government (delivered) Ventilators found in New York storage. N.Y. must distribute NOW!” Cuomo, 62, has urged the Trump administration this month to step up its fight to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which is now known to have infected more people in the United States than anywhere else in the world. The U.S. surpassed China and Italy on Thursday in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases. In New York,the epicenterof the U.S. outbreak,The New York Timesreportsthat as of Friday 432 people have died due to the virus, which causes the COVID-19 respiratory disease. One common symptom in the most severe cases is incapacitated lungs. Ventilators help patients by pumping oxygen into their lungs, keeping them alive as their bodies work to fight off the new virus. RELATED:Where and How the Bushes, Obamas, McCains & More Are Spending Their Social Distancing During Coronavirus We need the federal government to use the Defense Production Act so that we can get the medical supplies we desperately need. We can’t just wait for companies to come forward with offers and hope they will. This is a national emergency. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo)March 23, 2020 Officials on Trump’s coronavirus task force on ThursdaysaidNew York still has upwards of 2,000 ventilators not being used at the moment, but Cuomo has repeated that his request for more ventilators is to help combat the peak of the outbreak in New York, which health officials expect to come in about two weeks. “The president says it’s ‘a war,’ ” Cuomo said Tuesday during his daily press briefing. “Well, then, act like it’s a war!” He said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has only sent the state 400 ventilators. The Trump administration later said it would send 4,000 additional ventilators to the state. “You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators,” Cuomo fired back on Tuesday. Trump has avoided using the Defense Production Act, a wartime law which would allow the president to call on private manufacturing companies to help build equipment to fight the virus, including ventilators and other items that hospitals around the country say they’re seeing shortages of, like masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment. Trump and other administration officials have insisted that private manufacturing companies stepped up to help build ventilators on their own without the DPA’s authority being invoked. But Cuomo, who was managing a state with nearly 40,000 coronavirus cases as of Friday morning, said that’s not enough. “We need the federal government to use the Defense Production Act so that we can get the medical supplies we desperately need,” CuomotweetedMonday. “We can’t just wait for companies to come forward with offers and hope they will. This is a national emergency.” A spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment about Trump’s Fox News interview. The president has previously said he and Cuomo have a good relationship in working to fight the virus. His rhetoric on the seriousness of the virus changed last week after he earlier downplayed it compared to the seasonal flu and claimed his opponents were trying to politicize it as a “hoax.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Much to the delight of his fans, the 37-year-old actor debuted the scruffy gray facial hair he grew while social distancing amid thecoronavirus(COVID-19) pandemic in a rare Instagram selfie, before shaving it to film an episode ofSaturday Night Live. “Ok we got a show on Saturday time to shave and figure out how a camera works,” he captioned the post. “Grey facial hair, I did not see that coming,” one social media user said. While another wrote, “You’ve literally never looked better.” Several fans even called the comedian a “silver fox” and encouraged him to keep the beard. “Wow and I didn’t think I could love you anymore #silverfoxstatus,” a third person said.

On Sunday,SNLshared abehind-the-scenes clip of the transformation on Instagram, during which Jost says he was told to shave for the show because he “looks old.” “I’m about to do a segment we like to call, ‘Colin Shaves,'” he says at the beginning of the clip, before jokingly thanking his “sponsors”: toothpaste, showers and toilet paper. During the two-minute video, the comedian narrates the many phase of shaving. From a goatee to a patchy handlebar mustache, Jost hilariously describes each facial hair style and critiques himself along the way. “Mmm yeah. That’s pretty bad,” he says at one point. “It looks like I took some hair and some glue and just went, ‘Good. Mustache.'” He then shaved until he got to “the worst version of me,” he said sporting a goatee. “Here I am about half way through. I’d say this guy definite lives in Boston. He has somewhere between eight to 12 brothers. There were three brothers that were named Mike. He was goatee Mike.” RELATED:Colin Jost Has Hilarious Reaction toSNLCostar’s Impression of His Fiancée Scarlett Johansson The history-makingSNLepisode was hosted by actor Tom Hanks, who returned to the small screen for the first time since hetested positive for the coronavirus in March.

Instead, Chappelle toldNaomi Campbellon a recent episode of her YouTube seriesNo Filterthat it was unnamed celebrities who penned the messages. While the two reminisced about dancing at what Chappelle, 47, said was \"one of the last big parties the Obama threw,\" the comedian interjected with a story about the notes,which first made headlinesin 2019. \"I'm not gonna say these celebrities' names [but] there was a thing when the Trump administration moved in, they said the Obama staff left dirty notes for us in all the drawers and all the cabinets,\" Chappelle told Campbell, referencing a 2019 Fox News interview in which former White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham claimed that staffers from the Obama administrationhad left behind the mean messagesfor their replacements. Grisham said at the time: \"We came into the White House. I'll tell you something: Every office was filled with Obama books, and we had notes left behind that said 'You will fail,' 'You aren't going to make it.' \" A number of Obama staffers quickly pushed back on her account, including her predecessor.

While the Anderson family party will likely have to wait until the spring, she said will be getting away in the meantime. “I’m going to actually check out and go to the ocean for a few days and get away from this scene of madness,” she says. (Soon after,she posted from the beach.) Along with her will beboyfriend Tyler Nicholson, a fellow snowboarder who grew up in Ontario, Canada, and who competes for another team. “It’s been such a cool experience to be together here, and we almost feel like we’re in college because we’re going to the American house or sneaking into the Canadian house,” Anderson says, “and we all have like tiny beds so we can’t really cuddle, but we’ll just hang and go do our contests.” Asked about their relationship, Anderson coos, “Aww, my babe.” The ocean feels good 💙 chilling for a few days before Big Air! #jafreespirit #oceanvibes #mammanature #gratitude A post shared byJamie Anderson(@jamieanderson) onFeb 14, 2018 at 2:37am PST “We’ve been friends for a lot of years,” she says. “And it’s just so fun to have someone I can travel with who has a passion in the same area.

I think it’s hard to be a girl in a tough sport where you crash and you get black eyes and whatnot, but you’re able to keep rising above and I’m so impressed with our team.” Anderson’s Olympic achievement this week is a far cry from her reality TV days, when she appeared onThe Celebrity Apprenticein early 2014. That show’s host, too, is now far removed from the entertainment world. Asked about her time working withnow-President Donald Trump, Anderson says: “Working on theApprenticewas a really cool business experience. We were doing things, like showcasing magazine pieces and marketing different brands, and that was a really cool business opportunity and nice to get to know him [Trump] in a different way.” “And now seeing him as a leader, it’s like a totally yin/yang, I would have never seen that coming,” Anderson continues. “But I just have mutual respect for everything — I know there’s a lot of chaos, but I try to stay within myself and practice what I want to do in my life, which is living more sustainably and truly respecting our resources.

Protestors numbered as many as 200, according to NBC10 Boston. Some of them made signs including “Sick kids need doctors not deportation,” and at least one wore a coat that referenced the first lady’s notorious“I Really Don’t Care. Do U?”jacket that she wore last year while visiting a detention center holding migrant children in McAllen, Texas. The protestor had changed their jacket to read “We really do care do u?” RELATED:Melania Trump Says ‘I Really Don’t Care’ Jacket Was a Message to Media The protests were in part because the Boston Medical Center is considered a safety-net hospital and provides anImmigrant and Refugee Heath Programcatered to provide primary care services to immigrants and refugees. The hospital also offers medical affidavits in support of asylum applications, infectious disease screening, treatment for refugee or war trauma and evaluations for waivers for the U.S. citizenship exam if the patient suffers from a medical or cognitive disability. “This is not a person that we want to come to our home, our hospital,” one BMC employee told NBC10 Boston. Another employee, a BMC program director, told theGlobe, “We are not here in opposition of First Lady Trump being here. But we are really here to stand in solidarity with our patients and to let them know that we hear you. We understand you. We are here for you.” “I hope that [Mrs. Trump] can come here and learn about all of the wonderful work and the programs that are happening here,” the program director told the paper, “and that she can take that information back up to Capitol Hill with her and get this administration to think about policies and practices that are actually going to help people heal.” RELATED:Donald Trump Reportedly Said That Melania Wouldn’t Cry ‘Her Eyes Out’ If He Was in a Tragedy Mrs. Trump previously addressed her decision to wear the “I Really Don’t Care. Do U?” jacket at the height of controversy over the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy of separating migrant parents from their children at the border. President Trump campaigned on restricting immigration, both legal and illegal, and has made it a signature policy while in the White House. Mrs. Trump’s jacket — though taken by some as a gesture of indifference or even some kind of covert signal about her true feelings for her husband’s politics — was actually a message for the media, she has explained. “I wore the jacket to go on the plane and off the plane,” shetold ABC News in October 2018. “And it was for the people and for the left-wing media to show them that I don’t care. You will not stop me to do what I feel is right.” She said her jacket was critiquing the headlines she received. RELATED:First Lady Melania Trump Met with Schoolkids in N.Y.C.

She also toured the pediatric unit and met with families there who are in recovery. Through CALM, medical professionals cuddle newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome, which is caused when a baby experiences withdrawal from certain drugs they were exposed to in the womb, according tothe American Academy of Pediatrics. Supporters of this treatment say it helps lower stress for the infants. “As you may know, this is an issue I am very focused on,” Mrs. Trump said Wednesday at BMC. “I hope today’s visit helps shine a light on programs like yours.” She was joined by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, who said that the Trump administration was putting a special focus on the problem and was advancing clinical trials on neonatal opioid withdrawal.

Starring in Little Caesars’ first-ever ad for the big game,The Officestar, 54, plays the CEO of Sliced Bread Inc. — and he gets a rude awakening after learning what customers are saying about the pizza chain’snew delivery service. “Little Caesars delivery, that’s the best thing since sliced bread,” a customer quips, much to Wilson’s dismay. “We got a problem, there’s a new best thing,” a startled Wilson learns, before rejecting a long list of ideas — ranging from travel-sized bread to selling bedazzled loafs — on how to make the grocery staple exciting again. However, as the brainstorming sessions prove futile, Wilson really starts to lose it, especially when he discovers several employees eating Little Caesars in the office. From there, things descend into a literal fiery chaos, and by the end of the spot, Wilson has a new job: working as a delivery person for the pizza brand. Opening up about the ad, Wilson said it was a “blast to be a part of.” “I mean, we had a stuntwoman riding an ostrich,” he toldAdweek. “Nothing says Super Bowl commercial like someone riding an ostrich around the set. It was nuts.” And while the character he plays in the commercial wasn’t a fan of Little Caesars’ rise to success, Wilson says that Dwight Schrute, the character he played onthe Office, would likely have a different take on the situation. “Dwight Schrute is all about survival of the fittest,” said Wilson, adding that he thought the character would root for the pizza chain.

PBS reporter Yamiche Alcindor had originally asked Trump about what he believes some of his personal actions have said about how seriously he’s taken the coronavirus pandemic. While Trump declared he has saved “tens of thousands of lives” by introducing travel restrictions in February, Alcindor pointed out the president was still holding rallies. “You held rallies in February and March and there are some—” Alcindor said before Trump, 73, cut the reporter off. “I don’t know about rallies. I really don’t know about rallies,” Trump said. “I know one thing: I haven’t left the White House in months, except for a brief moment to give a wonderful ship, the [USNS] Comfort—” Alcindor jumped in to correct the president: “You held a rally in March,” the reporter said. “I don’t know.

In late February, Trump infamously complained at a political rally that the growing worry about the virus in the United States was simply a Democratic “hoax” designed to damage his presidency. Trump has also sparred with state officials, political rivals, and even the World Health Organization — deflecting blame for the slow American response on nearly everyone but his own administration. Moments after Alcindor pointed out Trump had held a political rally in March, the president shifted blame to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (his longtime Democratic rival) for holding a “street fair” in San Francisco “to prove that there’s no problem.” As information about thecoronavirus pandemicrapidly changes,PEOPLEis committed to providing the most recent data in our coverage.

First LadyJackie Kennedywas plunged into shock and despair when her husband,President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated at 46 in 1963. But even in the midst of unimaginable tragedy, she had a key focus: to ensure that his legacy endured. And to do that, she spun a fantasy that has only grown in the five decades since. On Nov. 29, 1963, four days after her husband’s burial, the widowed mother of two invitedLifemagazine journalist Theodore H. White to the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. There, Jackie, then just 34, crafted a glittering fairytale about JFK’s 1,000 days in the White House that continues to captivate the nation. The inspiration? JFK’s favorite Broadway musical,Camelot —the story of mythical world, ruled by King Arthur, where goodness reigned supreme. “Don’t let it be forgot, that for one brief, shining moment there was Camelot,” Jackie told White, quoting from the musical. In PEOPLE’s Dec. 2016 cover story, those who knew the iconic First Lady offer insight into what she shrewdly viewed as an opportunity to ensure that her husband’s achievements would never be forgotten. “She wanted to be sure he was remembered as a great President,” her longtime Secret Service agent Clint Hill, who was present for the interview and shared his memories of the First Lady in his 2012 memoirMrs. Kennedy and Me,tells PEOPLE.

The former mayor of New York Cityentered the race fairly late in the game(on Nov. 24, 2019) after announcing in March that he wasn’t going to run for president, but that didn’t deter Judy Sheindlin, famously known asJudge Judy, from pledging her support. The Emmy-award winner wrote an op-ed inUSA Todayoutlining why Bloomberg is her top choice. “An independent, tough-minded businessman, he represents our best chance to bring America together again and begin the long national process of healing,” Sheindlin wrote. “We need a no-nonsense president who’s sane, competent and honest, someone who can’t be bought and has no skin in the game. As he showed during 12 years as mayor in New York City Hall, Michael Bloomberg fits the bill,” she continued. “He’s a self-made billionaire, a man who made a lot of money in a very straightforward, transparent way. He’s an advocate for strong action on climate change. He believes in reasonable gun control, like the vast majority of Americans. He believes in making certain that the criminal element in our society — which scars the life of so many — is treated firmly, swiftly and fairly,” she added. Michael Douglashas also publicly pledged his support and toldPEOPLEthat he “hasn’t been this excited” about a presidential candidate sinceJohn F. Kennedy. “I feel so blessed that in this particularly difficult time that we have one of the greatest candidates in the history of our elections,” Douglas said. In his view, Bloomberg offers “a rare opportunity to coalesce and bring us back together, get rid of all this horrid, negative scare tactics that are going on, and the fact that he’s succeeded to the degree that he has is phenomenal.” Ted Dansonannounced on Jan. 27, 2020 that he’s all for the former mayor because “he has the strongest track record on climate change and will do the most to fight it.” He further explained on Instagram that the candidate plans to “completely phase out emissions in the electricity sector” and most importantly, “invest first in communities that have suffered most from coal pollution or have been left behind in the transition to clean energy.” The star concluded his post by addinga link to Bloomberg’s website, where his followers can learn more about the candidate’s climate efforts. Tim Gunn is also backing Bloomberg, and has officially joined on as a member of Bloomberg’s LGBTQ Leadership Council. “When I talked to his campaign yesterday, they said, ‘We’re getting into this late’ and I thought, Maybe that’s a real advantage,” Gunn told PEOPLE. “He hasn’t been part of this squabbling and bickering. Now he can just ride in like a knight in shining armor.” Grammy-award winning singer-songwriterJohn Mellencamplent his song “Small Town” — and his endorsement — to the Bloomberg campaign, writing, “The stakes are too high to not nominate the candidate who will take the fight directly to Trump,” in a statement released by the former mayor. “From small towns to big cities, Mike Bloomberg has the experience to represent all Americans. He’s a job creator, philanthropist, and true public servant, and I am confident that as president, he will restore America to a place we can be proud of once again.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: While Fox News hostSean Hannityamplified claims about the 2020 election being rife with fraud, privately, it seems, he knew the allegations were bogus. Testifying under oath as part of a deposition in a case brought by voting equipment company Dominion Voting Systems, Hannity said, \"I did not believe it for one second,\" when asked about the claims of fraud, which continue to be made by former PresidentDonald Trump, despite any evidence to support them. Hannity reportedly wasn't the only Fox News personality not to believe the false claims about the election. \"Many of the highest-ranking Fox people have admitted under oath that they never believed the Dominion lies,\" Dominion lawyer Stephen Shackelford toldThe New York Times, specifically namingTucker Carlsonand Meade Cooper, who oversees prime-time programming for the network. Dominion found itself the target of conspiracies of widespread election fraud and other wrongdoing in the wake of the November 2020 presidential election,eventually suingseveral of Trump's closest allies, including Fox News, for repeating lies about them. Among those statements were unfounded allegations that Dominion manipulated vote totals and had ties to the regime of late Venezuelan authoritarian Hugo Chavez. The company was founded in Toronto and is now based in Denver. In March 2021, Dominion sued Fox News Media in Delaware for $1.6 billion, according to a copy of the complaint shared with the press. The suit singled out some of the company's most prominent conservative hosts including Hannity; Carlson;Maria Bartiromo;Lou Dobbs, who subsequently left Fox Business; andJeanine Pirro. \"Fox sold a false story of election fraud in order to serve its own commercial purposes, severely injuring Dominion in the process,\" the complaint states. Dominion CEO John Poulos said in an interview with60 Minutesearlier this year that executives and hosts at the network were aware the voter fraud claims were false, but continued to promote them anyway. \"We told them. We told them in real time. Others told them. Government officials told them. Partisan government officials told 'em. People inside the Trump administration told them. Um, local election officials on both sides of the aisle told 'em. This is not a matter of not knowing the truth. They knew the truth,\" Poulos said. Hannity has been a staunch defender and close confidant of Trump in recent years. He has also tried toshift blame for the Jan. 6 Capitol riotsfrom the former president, even while condemning the violence during his broadcast. \"All of today's perpetrators must be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" Hannity said on the air on Jan. 6, 2021. \"But every good and decent American, we know, will and must condemn what happened at the Capitol, and moving forward, we have to do a dramatically better job protecting the innocent men and women who work there.\" The House of Representatives committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack made public text messages Hannity sent to then-White House chief of staffMark Meadowsin which he spoke about the Jan. 6 rally — which was known as \"Stop the Steal\" and predicated on the notion that the election had been stolen from Trump — and election integrity in general. \"We can't lose the entire WH counsels office. I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he is being told. After the 6 th. [sic] He should announce will lead the nationwide effort to reform voting integrity. Go to Fl and watch Joe mess up daily. Stay engaged. When he speaks people will listen,\" Hannity wrote on Dec. 31, 2020, according to a letter from the committee.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Because those words, while not reflective of my beliefs, echo the real experience of too many women. I’d like to help make that right,” he added. Portnow’s comments on women needing to “step up” in the music businesscaused an uproar, and several musicians, includingPink,Katy Perryand Kelly Clarkson,slammed the Grammys execon social media as nearly 10,000 people — including celebrities —signing a petitiondemanding Portnow step down from his presidential/CEO post at the Recording Academy.

RELATED GALLERY:From White Roses to Kesha’s Moving Performance: Every Time Celebs Showed Support for Time’s Up at the Grammys “The Recording Academy is establishing an independent task force to review every aspect of what we do as an organization and identify where we can do more to overcome the explicit barriers and unconscious biases that impede female advancement in the music community,” Portnow said in his latest statement. “We will also place ourselves under a microscope and tackle whatever truths are revealed.” Concluding, “I appreciate that the issue of gender bias needs to be addressed in our industry, and share in the urgency to attack it head on. We as an organization, and I as its leader, pledge our commitment to doing that. We will share more information about the steps we are taking in the coming weeks.” RELATED:All the Grammys Moments We Can’t Stop Talking About Amid the Time’s Up and #MeToo movements, this year’sGrammy Awardswere a male-dominated affair — despite women taking center stage with powerful messages about the need for equality and attendees showing solidarity with victims of sexual harassment and assault by wearingwhite roses.

In the press room following the awards ceremony Sunday, Portnow told reporters: “It has to begin with women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level … [They need] to step up because I think they would be welcome. I don’t have personal experience of those kinds of brick walls that you face but I think it’s upon us — us as an industry — to make the welcome mat very obvious, breeding opportunities for all people who want to be creative and paying it forward and creating that next generation of artists.” Portnow previously released a statement on Tuesday regarding his comments. “Sunday night, I was asked a question about the lack of female artist representation in certain categories of this year’s Grammy Awards. Regrettably, I used two words, �?step up,’ that, when taken out of context, do not convey my beliefs and the point I was trying to make,” Portnow said.

We must actively work to eliminate these barriers and encourage women to live their dreams and express their passion and creativity through music. We must welcome, mentor, and empower them. Our community will be richer for it,” Portnow’s statement continued. The statement concluded: “I regret that I wasn’t as articulate as I should have been in conveying this thought. I remain committed to doing everything I can to make our music community a better, safer, and more representative place for everyone.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The president said Sunday that he knew that bin Laden was a threat before the 9/11 attacks at a time when \"nobody\" had \"ever heard of\" bin Laden On Sunday, PresidentDonald Trumpconfirmed that long-hunted Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadihad been killed. Then he claimed, not for the first time, that if anyone had bothered listening to him back in 2000, al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden would have been killed long before 2011. After announcing Baghdadi’s death, the president said Sunday that he knew that bin Laden was a threat before the 9/11 attacks at a time when “nobody” had “ever heard of” bin Laden. Indeed, Trump boasted, he had spelled out these concerns in a book. This is not true, but it is in keeping with a president who has a history of exaggerations, lies and misstatements of fact. “About a year — you’ll have to check — a year, year and a half before the World Trade Center came down, the book came out,” Trump told reporters on Sunday at a White House news conference about al-Baghdadi’s death. “I was talking about Osama bin Laden,” Trump said, referring to his bookThe America We Deserve, published in January 2000. “I said, ‘You have to kill him. You have to take him out.’ Nobody listened to me.” RELATED:See Side-by-Side Photos of Donald Trump During ISIS Leader Raid and Barack Obama Watching Osama bin Laden Operation He continued, “Let’s put it this way: If they would have listened to me, a lot of things would have been different.” Trump claimed that people still applaud him for this demand for bin Laden’s death — echoing a favorite rhetorical tactic in which he alludes, without evidence, to widespread anonymous support. “To this day, I get people coming up to me,” Trump told reporters. “And they said, ‘You know what one of the most amazing things I’ve ever seen about you is that you predicted that Osama bin Laden had to be killed before he knocked down the World Trade Center.’ It’s true. Now, most of the press doesn’t want to write that, but it is true. If you go back, look at my book.” In reality, bin Laden was a known threat whenThe America We Deservewas first published. The terrorist was only mentioned in the book in passing,according to the Associated Press. Trump wrote that bin Laden was just one of many threats that the U.S. faced at the time. “One day we’re told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin Laden is public enemy Number One, and U.S. jet fighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan,” Trump wrote. “He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it’s on to a new enemy and new crisis.” Trump never called for bin Laden’s death or advised that American forces should take further action, according to the AP. In 1998, then-PresidentBill Clintonordered military action in Afghanistan and Sudan following the al-Qaida bombings of U.S. embassies. Clinton was criticized (as was his successor, PresidentGeorge W. Bush) for not doing more because bin Laden survived, per the AP. Three years later, al-Qaida attacked the World Trade Center, which previously had been bombed in 1993. InThe America We Deserve, Trump did correctly infer that a big attack was coming — and acknowledged that this idea was also shared among experts. “I really am convinced we’re in danger of the sort of terrorist attacks that will make the [’93] bombing of the Trade Center look like kids playing with firecrackers,” Trump wrote,according to CNN. “No sensible analyst rejects this possibility, and plenty of them, like me, are not wondering if but when it will happen.” Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)November 19, 2018 Trump did not write that bin Laden would orchestrate the attack. But his claim otherwise mirrorswhat he wrote on Twittera year ago. “Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did,” Trump tweeted on Nov. 19, 2018. “I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!..” Multiple outlets were quick to fact check Trump following his tweet and after his comments on Sunday. The White House had no comment.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

That's clear,\" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday The White House said this weekDonald Trumpand Dr.Anthony Fauciare at odds over how certainly to talk about schools reopening in the fall and how that process might look. It was the latest crack in a growing divide between the president's messaging and health officials' guidance about thenovel coronavirus. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Thursday morning that Trump disagrees with Fauci, an expert on infectious diseases who has been a face for the administration in providing daily updates on their virus strategy, about what schools should do amid the pandemic before a vaccine exists. \"As [Trump] said, they have differing viewpoints,\" McEnany, 32, said outside the White House. \"That's clear.\" \"The president has a number of experts he takes into consultation and he decides what is best to go forward,\" McEnany said. \"The president regularly talks to the doctors. … He ultimately makes the decision as to how to move forward. After all, he was elected by the American people to do just that.” The confirmation of the president's disagreement with one of his own experts comes after he said Wednesday afternoon that he was \"surprised\" by Fauci's assessment that the local governments should be cautious in moving to reopen their schools by the fall. Classes were moved online or canceled in the wake of the virus' spread in the spring. “I was surprised by his answer,” Trump, 73, told reporters Wednesday. “To me it’s not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools.” \"The only thing that would be acceptable, as I said, is professors, teachers, etc. over a certain age — I think they ought to take it easy for another few weeks: five weeks, four weeks, who knows,\" the president said. \"Whatever it may be. But I think they have to be careful because this is a disease that attacks age and it attacks health. ... But with the young children and students, it’s really — it’s just — take a look at the statistics. It’s pretty amazing.\" However, Fauci warned Congress this week that the country should be careful in reopening its schools and not be \"cavalier\" about doing so, especially given there will be no vaccine for the coronavirus by the fall and that health experts still don't know everything about the virus, which causes the COVID-19 respiratory illness that's infectedmore than 4.3 million people worldwide. RELATED:Dr. Fauci Warns Sen. Rand Paul Not to Be 'Cavalier' on COVID-19 Impact on Kids After Lawmaker's Critique Data indicates children are at a much lower risk of dying from the coronavirus than people 65 and older or those with underlying health conditions. But Fauci, who has served as a director at the National Institutes of Health since 1984, and other health officials have warned lawmakers not to rush to judgement that it's safe to send kids back to school as medical experts are still learning about the unknowns of the novel coronavirus. “You’re right in the numbers that children in general do much, much better than adults and the elderly and particularly those with underlying conditions,\" Fauci, 79, told members of the Senate on Wednesday. \"But I am very careful, and hopefully humble in knowing that I don’t know everything about this disease. And that’s why I’m very reserved in making broad predictions.” \"We just have to see on a step-by-step basis as we get into the period of time with the fall about reopening the schools, exactly where we will be in the dynamics of the outbreak,\" Fauci said. \"My concern, that if some areas, city, states or what have you jump over those various checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks,\" he said. Elsewhere this week, health officials warned other members of Congress that if states rushes to reopen without a vaccine then they could be at risk of another outbreak in the fall. Dr. Rick Bright, a virologist who filed a whistleblower complaint earlier this month alleging he was fired as the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) after disagreeing with Trump's promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, testified in the House of Representatives on Thursday that the \"window is closing\" for the U.S. to form an effective and coordinated plan to stop the virus. \"Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history,\" Brighttoldmembers of the House. \"Americans deserve the truth\" and \"the truth must be based on science,\" Bright said. \"The window is closing to address this pandemic because we still do not have a standard, centralized, coordinated plan to take our nation through this response,\" hesaid. \"I believe with properly leadership and collaboration across government, with the best science leading the way, we can devise a comprehensive strategy, we can devise a plan that includes all of Americans and help them help us guide us through this pandemic. But time is running out because the virus is still spreading everywhere.\" On Thursday, the president brushed off Bright as \"an angry, disgruntled employee\" and said he \"didn't do a very good job\" as the director of BARDA, though Trump has alsoclaimedhe'd \"never heard of him [Bright].\" RELATED:'It Is Scary to Go to Work': Inside Coronavirus Prevention at the White House as Staffers Get Infected Trump has split with health officials before regarding the coronavirus. He's ignored their recommendations about protective practices (such as wearing a mask) and floated suggestions for unproven methods of treatment, including hydroxychloroquine or injecting disinfectant into the body. The president retweeted a \"#FireFauci\" hashtag last month, while Bright contends he was removed from his position because of disagreeing with the president publicly endorsing hydroxychloroquine (an anti-malaria drug some health experts warn has no clinically proven effect on coronavirus and could cause deadly heart problems). More than 84,000 people in the U.S. have died from the virus,according to aNew York Timestracker.

In part because of the contrast between the two administrations and in part because of rampant rumors and misinformation outside the U.S., some of the new migrantsbelieveBiden to be much more welcoming than Trump — though many restrictions are still in place Speaking toToday, Biden lay the blame squarely at the feet of the Trump administration while conservatives have been assailing his choices. \"Hey look — here's what happened,\" Biden said. \"The failure to have a real transition — the two departments that didn't give us access to virtually anything were the Immigration and the Defense Department. So we didn't fire out that they had fired a whole lot of people, that they were understaffed considerably.\" Biden's Friday comments echoed remarks he gave in February, duringan interview with ABC News: \"I can say quite clearly: Don't come.\" Speaking toToday, Biden said his administration was now communicating directly with would-be migrants in their home countries, urging them to apply for citizenship from their current homes, rather than by attempting to cross the border illegally. \"What we're doing now, is we're going back to those countries in question where most of the [immigration] is coming from and saying: 'Look. You can apply from your country. You don't have to make this trek,' \" he said. As advocates previously explained to PEOPLE, the majority of those coming to the U.S. illegally are attempting to escape dangerous situations. \"These children are fleeing situations of extraordinary danger and violence, otherwise they wouldn't be making the journey,\" said Jennifer Nagda, policy director at The Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, an advocacy group for immigrant children. RELATED:Biden Administration Asks FEMA to Help with Increase of Migrant Children at the Southern Border Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in March the Biden administration planned to invest $4 billion into Central America's Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an effort to \"address the root causes of migration.\" In March, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki addressed the conditions in which the migrant children were being held in the U.S., which have drawn the most scrutiny. \"It's not acceptable,\" she said. \"But I think the challenge here is that there are only — there are not that many options. … We have a lot of critics, but many of them are not putting forward a lot of solutions.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

While discussing the rising tensions between his country and North Korea, Moon said, with the help of a translator, that “North Korea has continued to make provocations, and this is extremely deplorable.” In response, Trump quipped that he was “very happy you used the word deplorable. I was very interested in that word. “I promise I did not tell him to use that word,” he added to laughs from Vice President Mike Pence and others in the room. “That’s been a very lucky word for me and many millions of people.” Trump was referencing 2016 rival Hillary Clinton’s campaign-season gaffe in which she said that half of Trump’s supporters fit in a “basket of deplorables.” The comment, which came less than two months before Election Day, was widely criticized, with some political analysts even wondering later whether it could have played a role in Clinton’s unexpected loss. The moniker was also co-opted by the Trump campaign and his supporters, who continue to wear the nickname like a badge of honor.

We will not be contributing to the fanfare of the games.\" The games begin Feb. 4 and close Feb. 20.

There they discussed the upcoming presidential election and “our shared goals,” including “beatingDonald Trump” and championing progressive economic policies, she said Monday. “Among the topics that came up was what would happen if Democrats nominated a female candidate,” she said. “I thought a woman could win; he disagreed.” Sanders disputes this. “It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn’t win,” he told CNN in a statement. (His campaign did not respond to a request for comment from PEOPLE.) The Washington Postreportedthat one person with knowledge of the conversation said Sanders didn’t say a woman couldn’t win the 2020 election but instead was saying Trump “would use nefarious tactics against the Democratic nominee,” supporting how Sanders characterized their discussion. “What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could,” Sanders said in his statement. “Do I believe a woman can win in 2020?

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: On Feb. 4, 1983, singer Karen Carpenter fell victim to heart failure brought on by the chemical emetine after an eight-year battle with anorexia nervosa. Today, March 2, 2020, she would have been 70 years old On Feb. 4, 1983, singer Karen Carpenter fell victim to heart failure brought on by the chemical emetine after an eight-year battle with anorexia nervosa. Today, March 2, 2020, she would have been 70 years old. We pay tribute by running our cover story from the Feb. 21, 1983 issue of PEOPLE below. Iced tea was the hardest drink she consumed, and the only needles she used were for needlepoint. Her weirdest stash was a collection of Mickey Mouse memorabilia. The flagrant comet tail of self-indulgence so familiar in plummeting stars like Elvis Presley and John Belushi did not mark Karen Carpenter’s life—or her death of heart failure on Feb. 4 at the age of 32. Yet for all the soothing middle-of-the-road appeal she and her composer-arranger brother, Richard, 37, brought to 41 Carpenters records—which have sold 80 million copies and won three Grammy Awards—she had led a long, lonely struggle against another form of self-destruction, anorexia nervosa. She collapsed at about 9 a.m. in the wardrobe closet of the room her parents have always kept for her at the family home in suburban Downey, Calif., about 30 minutes from Los Angeles. Downey firemen entered the closet to find Karen slumped nude on the floor, her nightgown draping her body. She had apparently just begun to dress for the day. At the request of the rescue workers, Karen’s grief-stricken mother, Agnes, was escorted from the room by husband Harold. The rescuers at first detected a faint pulse in Karen’s neck that made them think, says paramedic Bob Gillis, that “she had a good chance to survive.” But then she went into cardiac arrest. Racing over from his house a few minutes away, Richard Carpenter arrived just before the paramedics carried his sister out to the ambulance. Despite continuous efforts to resuscitate her, Karen was pronounced dead at Downey Community Hospital at 9:51 a.m. A wave of grief spread among those who had known her. “She was a magical person with a magical voice,” says Burt Bacharach, who in 1963 had written the song which became the Carpenters’ first hit, Close to You. Adds Paul Williams, author of their second gold smash, We’ve Only Just Begun: “Karen and Richard’s music brought the American family together during a period when there was very little else it could share.” Williams’ apparent reference to the turbulent Vietnam and Watergate eras was apt. The Carpenters were at their zenith in 1973, when then President Richard Nixon introduced the duo to a glittering White House audience as “young America at its very best.” In the aftershock, friends wondered if Karen had tried too hard to live up to that description, had perhaps died trying. Hers was the “good girl’s” disease—a compulsive urge to control weight, primarily among female hyper-achievers, that leads to such extremes as self-induced vomiting and taking huge doses of laxatives. An autopsy revealed no immediate explanation for her heart failure. But after a long bout with anorexia, says Dr. Joel Yager of UCLA’s Eating Disorders Clinic, “the most common cause of death is low serum potassium, which can cause an irregularity in the heartbeat.” Karen had spent almost all of 1982 in New York undergoing treatment, and had lifted her weight from a gaunt 85 to 108 pounds—very near normal for her frame and height, 5’4″. But, as anorexia expert Dr. Raymond Vath of Seattle points out, doctors learned only two months ago that the greatest strain is put on an anorectic’s heart when lost weight is regained. Paul Bloch, the Carpenter family’s PR man, downplays the anorexia connection. “Karen was a vibrant and energetic person,” he insists. Concurs Gil Friesen, president of A&M Records, the Carpenters’ label, “Karen was the girl next door, always up even when she was down.” Typical signs of anorectics, says Dr. Yager. “It’s common for them to be sweet,” he says. “Many keep their emotions inside. They take care of other people, but they don’t take care of themselves.” Karen’s condition was alarmingly obvious. A co-worker who had seen her early last year said she resembled “a living skull.” Added another, “She appeared to be a tormented and unhappy woman.” Indeed, as far back as 1971, when the Carpenters were soaring on their early hits, Karen was “psychotic about her weight,” an acquaintance recalls. “She had a classic pear-shaped figure—she was chubby, and she was very self-conscious about it.” Tom Burris, the real estate developer whom Karen married in 1980 and from whom she was separated last year, says she was suffering from anorexia “for about nine years.” The term, though, was not widely known in 1975, when Karen slipped frighteningly from her performing weight of 110 to a shadowy 90 pounds. It took two months of bed rest at home to recuperate from physical and nervous exhaustion brought on by some 250 days a year of arduous touring. “It was sickening,” she told PEOPLE after getting back on her feet the next year. “Suddenly it wasn’t fun anymore.” Though much had changed in her life by 1981, Karen was still taking a vengeful attitude toward her weight. Distraught, she reached out to Pat Boone’s daughter, Cherry Boone O’Neill, who was finishing a book about her own anorexia, Starving for Attention. They spoke once in person, then three times on the telephone. “She didn’t sound panicked, but she felt that she really needed some help,” recalls Cherry, now 28. “Karen was having particular problems with laxatives. She could not believe she could ever get to a point where she was not dependent on them.” O’Neill, who herself had often taken laxatives by the box to “drop 10 or 15 pounds overnight,” urged her friend to “get away from the pressures of L.A. and show business and concentrate on her own life and survival.” She told Cherry: “I’m going to do it. I’ll get well—it’s just so damn hard.” Like Cherry, Karen was raised in an unusually close-knit family. The children of a printer and a homemaker, Karen and Richard moved with their parents from New Haven, Conn, to Downey in 1963. “Karen grew up in a very tight, parentally dominated world,” says a longtime friend. “Her parents are very nice people, but they controlled her early life and continued to try and do so over the years.” One incident from early in Karen and Richard’s career may be typical. Agnes Carpenter called her offspring at their Cincinnati motel to scold them for not having signed autographs backstage following a show in Hershey, Pa. after a fan wrote to complain. Dutifully, the youngsters called the fan and apologized. Anorectics, notes Cherry, are usually the children of authoritative parents. “Such a person,” she says, “does not rebel.” Richard was the first to take up music, inspired by his “Three B’s—the Beatles, Beach Boys and Burt Bacharach.” A sports fan, Karen was handed a glockenspiel in the high school marching band and figured it out. Wielding chopsticks on bar stools, she eventually taught herself percussion well enough to tap along with Dave Brubeck’s rhythmically challenging album, Time Further Out. The duo won a Hollywood Bowl Battle of the Bands, and after three years of scrounging for work were signed by A&M co-founder Herb Alpert. “It was interesting the way they made records,” a close colleague observes. “Richard laid out all the basic tracks, and then Karen would come in and sing. He was a tyrant in the studio. She would spend a lot of time on her vocals, and was always hard on herself.” An ex-employee of A&M agrees: “It always seemed as if she were under Richard’s thumb.” Barry Manilow observes that Karen clearly “adored” Richard. “She couldn’t speak highly enough of him. To her, he was a genius.” Yet it was clearly Karen’s voice that made the Carpenters click. “I’m sure she felt she had to measure up, that the whole act kind of hinged on her,” Cherry O’Neill says. “That’s an awful lot of pressure for one individual.” Karen’s apparent solution, suggests Cherry, was classic: “When you start denying yourself food, and begin feeling you have control over a life that has been pretty much controlled for you, it’s exhilarating. The anorectic feels that while she may not be able to control anything else, she will, by God, control every morsel that goes in her mouth.” Karen’s anorectic episodes in the ’70s seem to have waxed and waned, and in 1976, after her two-month recuperation at home, she made a stab at independence from her parents by moving into her own large apartment in a Century City condo. In 1980 her mother urged Karen to attend a dinner at the chic Ma Maison restaurant that Karen wanted to skip, and there she met Tom Burris, a 39-year-old divorcé with an 18-year-old son. Two months later they were engaged. Although Burris insists “We always got along, always cared about each other,” they soon grew apart. “Karen was dealing with her anorexia and her career, I was dealing with my real estate problems,” he explains. “I feel totally guilty, like I’d like to reverse everything. I tried to work with her. I got her in touch with a doctor, but she wouldn’t admit she had an eating problem. We both tried, but we just couldn’t work it out.” Later Karen reached out to the physician who treated Cherry O’Neill, Dr. Vath of Seattle. “She wanted a quick fix,” he recalls. “She told me she had all these contracts and just had to get well. But I said, ‘No, Karen, we don’t know how to treat this rapidly. It would take a minimum of a year, probably three, to get you well.’ ” Finally she agreed to a course of treatment in a New York hospital, where she took two-hour treatments every day for nearly a year. But even there, as Dionne Warwick discovered, Karen’s weight rose faster than her spirits. “She had gone through a lot of depression and sadness,” said Warwick. “When a marriage breaks up, it’s a devastating thing.” Last December Karen returned to L.A. O’Neill was concerned: “Putting yourself in the same environment where the problems first developed without totally recovering can cause setbacks.” But by most accounts Karen was suffused with new energy. She was planning to record an album this spring. “Karen was getting along great,” insists her longtime hairdresser, Arthur Johns, who gave her a perm before New Year’s and says she intended to come back to have her hair streaked bronze. “She had started writing songs for the first time. She wasn’t the type of person to mop the floor with her tears.” Clearly, Karen Carpenter intended to conquer despair. “I have,” she told Warwick just two weeks before her death, “a lot of living left to do.” — Eric Levin; Suzanne Adelson; Gail Buchalter; Joseph Pilcher\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Devin Blake Langford was one of the 14 children and three mothers who were attacked and gunned down near the United States’ Arizona border on Monday, his relative Kendra Lee Millerwrote on Facebookearly Tuesday morning. The three mothers, Christina Langford, Rhonita Miller and Dawna Langford, were each driving separate SUVs from their family community, LaMora, in Sonora, Mexico. Devin was in his mother Dawna’s car when their vehicle was attacked, Kendra said on Facebook. Dawna, 43, and two of her sons — Devin’s younger brothers, Trevor, 11, and Rogan, 2½ — died as bullets tore through their car. The second oldest of the family, Devin took action, hiding those of his siblings who managed to escape under branches in nearby bushes before walking the 14 miles back to LaMora for help. While Kylie, 14, McKenzie, 9, Cody, 8, Jake, 6, Xander, 4, and Brixon, only nine months, waited for Devin, he bravely made his way through the mountainous region for aid. It took Devin six hours to get back to family members, and McKenzie ended up leaving while he was gone, also looking for help. RELATED:9 U.S. Citizens, Including Twin Babies, Killed in Mexico on Way to Wedding When Devin arrived at LaMora around 5:30 p.m., he brought the first news of the deadly attack with him. According to Kendra, “Devin’s uncles armed themselves with guns and returned to try and find the hidden children, knowing many of them were injured. They didn’t get far before realizing they would be risking death, since there had been continual shooting for hours, all over the mountains near LaMora. The group of men waited a while for reinforcements, and around 7:30, found the hidden children.” Yet when the men arrived, McKenzie was missing, as she had fled for help when her older brother didn’t return quickly. After two more hours of searching, McKenzie was found. By nightfall, Devin’s father David Langford arrived from Tuscon, Arizona. David accompanied the five injured children in a helicopter back to the U.S. to get treated, and Devin, Jake, and Faith remained in LaMora. Christina’s car was with Dawna’s when the ambush began, and the 31-year-old mother was shot and died after she leapt from her vehicle in a desperate plea for the attackers to stop, according to Kendra’s post. Christina’s baby daughter Faith — whose car seat had been hurriedly set on the floor of the car — miraculously survived. Rhonita’s car was discovered about 10 miles away from Dawna and Christina’s cars. The 30-year-old mother and her children Howard, 12, Krystal, 10, and twins Titus and Tiana, eight months, all died in the attack, as their car caught fire from all the gunfire. The family members were all “burned to mostly ashes and only a few charred bones [were] left to identify that all five had been inside,” Kendra wrote. RELATED VIDEO: Texas Cop Convicted Of Murder For Shooting Neighbor In His Home Relatives of the family told multiple news outlets that they believe the attack was a case of mistaken identity by drug cartel gunmen, but authorities have not publicly released the motive — or named any suspects in the killings. The FBI has joined Mexican officials in investigating the brutal killings. “Everyone is in so much shock,” said relative Willie Jessop,according to NBC News. “It’s just unbelievable, and there’s just no way to comprehend it.” Donald Trump called the attackers “monsters” in atweeton Tuesday, and added that “the United States stands ready, willing & able to get involved and do the job quickly and effectively.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Experts share tips for reducing the risk of exposure from your diet As thecoronaviruscontinues tospread in the U.S., leading to restaurant closures and extremesocial distancing measures, many people are finding themselves cooking all their meals at home—but even with that comes some theoretical risk. First, there’s the grocery store. Incities where stay-at-home ordersare in place, supermarkets and pharmacies still remain open as “essential services”, often drawing crowds as people make outings to restock their refrigerators and pantries. With more people comes higher risk of exposure, and in recent days there have been multiple cases of grocery store employees testing positive for COVID-19, with Trader Joe’s eventemporarily closing two locationsin Manhattan due to the issue. Minimizing trips and going to the store during off hours (early in the morning or late at night) is the best way to reduce your risk, but experts say there are further precautionary measures you can take. “I would wear gloves — rubber gloves, leather, any kind, and be sure you wash your hands when you come home,” Dr. William Haseltine, infectious disease expert and Chair and President of ACCESS Health International, tells PEOPLE. To avoid walking inside, many grocery stores are now offering curbside pick-up. Additionally, services likeInstacart,ShiptandAmazon Freshwill deliver groceries to your door with no contact—though many areas are now seeing multiple day wait times. RELATED:Here’s What Chain Restaurants Like McDonald’s, Domino’s, and Chipotle Are Doing Amid Coronavirus Crisis Once you do have groceries, there’s the question of how to handle them. In a recentinterviewwith theDaily Mail, associate professor at the University of Sydney Timothy Newsome recommended washing fresh produce “with warm soapy water, just as you do your hands.” But is this really necessary, and is it safe in itself? “Using soap has never really been recommended for fresh produce before, and our recommendation has still been to use water and rinse,” Francisco Diez-Gonzalez, director of Center for Food Safety at the University of Georgia, tells PEOPLE. “But if people want to do it, it’s innocuous. I don’t have any evidence that it will for sure reduce risk of the virus because we don’t have the research.” Dr. Haseltine adds that washing with soap “can help” minimize risk, but questions the practicality of it in many circumstances. “I wouldn’t wash your lettuce with soapy water,” he says, “but something like a potato or an apple or a plum you can wash, the outside of a mango you can wash.” RELATED VIDEO: Prince Charles Tests Positive for Coronavirus Both Diez-Gonzalez and Haseltine acknowledge that the safest way to ensure food safety is heat and cooking. “Your best friend when it comes to any pathogens or organisms is cooking,” says Diez-Gonzalez. “If you’re really concerned about not being exposed to any source, just eat cooked vegetables.” Ultimately, though, the risk of exposure through your diet appears to be low. “There is almost no evidence that implicates that food as a vehicle for causing this disease,” adds Diez-Gonzalez. “The evidence we have is still largely person-to-person transmission.” “We’re not talking about zero risk, we’re talking about dramatic risk reduction,” says Dr. Haseltine. “Zero risk…you’d have to be in a space station, and even then it can come up with your food. So there’s no zero risk, there’s risk reduction.” As information about the coronavirus pandemic rapidly changes ,PEOPLEis committed to providing the most recent data in our coverage.

For years, there were just two states — Utah and Idaho — that did not have laws in place toprotect nursing motherswho need tobreastfeed in public. But with new legislation, both states are now on board. The bill passed in Utahwith some resistance — the legislation at first stated that “A woman may breastfeed in any place of public accommodation … irrespective of whether the woman’s breast is uncovered during or incidental to the breast-feeding,” in line with the rest of the country. But, according to theSalt Lake Tribune, Republican Representative Curt Webb thought the wording would lead to immodesty. “This seems to say you don’t have to cover up at all,” Webb said. “I’m not comfortable with that, I’m just not. It’s really in your face.” With the second part of the bill removed — it now just reads that women are permitted “to breastfeed in any place of public accommodation,” it passed through the state legislature with a vote of 66-5. Idaho’s vote was smoother, with a vote of 66-0 approving legislation that protects breastfeeding mothers from indecent exposure and obscenity laws, according to theIdaho Statesman. However, the bill does not make it completely clear, as other states have done, that women have the right to breastfeed in public. However, issues with the wording notwithstanding, with these two pieces of legislation it isofficially legal to breastfeed in publicin all 50 states. The United States is now up to speed with the U.K., Australia and other countries across the world that protect nursing mothers.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Writers forThe Daily Show with Trevor Noahknow how difficult it can be to keep up withPresident Trump‘s incessant tweets, which is why they’ve written a new book,The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Library.The satirical book, out Tuesday, serves as a companion toThe Daily Show‘sinteractive pop-up exhibition, which catalogues the commander-in-chief’s most shocking and controversial tweets. “When we saw [the tweets] all together in one place, even for those of us who had worked on it for six months, it made a huge impression,” says executive producer Steve Bodow in an exclusive interview with PEOPLE. “This guy [President Trump] has said and tweeted so many crazy, incredible things that you can’t possibly keep up because it comes so fast and furious. [We] collect[ed] them all, first in the exhibit and then in the book, [because] we wanted to do a service for the people.” “We want [readers] to be able to laugh instead of cry,” adds executive producer Jen Flanz. The Daily Show with Trevor Noahopened its first pop-up library dedicated to the president’s tweets in New York City in June 2017. Crowds flocked to the exhibition, which also appeared in Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The book serves as an exhibition catalog based on the real-life library, and also features brand-new collections, according to the press release. Just like the exhibition, the book divides Trump’s tweets into categories like: “SAD!: A Retrospective,” “Trump vs. Trump,” “The Nicknames” and “Verified Survivors.” The “Verified Survivors” section references a tweet that Trump wrote on Feb. 25, 2016, after he learned that former Mexican president Vicente Foxused profanity while declaring that Mexico will not pay for the wallthat Trump insists should be built between the U.S. and Mexico. “FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall,” Trump wrote. “He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!” FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)February 25, 2016 The book shows Fox’s response to his adversary’s criticism. “Donald, every time I read your tweets and hear you on the TV, I struggle not to say the F word. I apologized once.” Fox writes. “I f—ing regret it. You will be hearing from me every day until you leave office, so you better get used to it.” Under the “Masterworks” category, a frame has been placed ironically around Trump’s first tweet questioning then-President Barack Obama’s citizenship. “An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that @BarackObama’s birth certificate is a fraud,” Trump tweeted on Aug. 6, 2012. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that@BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)August 6, 2012 “Critics may disagree on the greatest of Trump’s tweets, but all cite ‘Birth of a Birther’ as his first unquestionable masterpiece,” readsThe Daily Showcontributors’ caption next to the tweet. “Taken as a standalone work, one can marvel at the audacity of his creative imagination — the delicacy of the halo of quotations encircling ‘extremely credible source.’ ” While extensive, the book isn’t a comprehensive look at all of Trump’s most memorable tweets. Bodow explains that because Trump fires off so many tweets a week, the book only includes the “masterpieces” that Trump tweeted before May 2018. “People [atThe Daily Show] know the history of Trump’s Twitter feed probably better than anybody else in the world,” he jokes. “Probably better than Trump,” Flanz adds. Flanz’s favorite section of the book is an illustration of a grey “Wall of Tweets.” “It’s a big monolithic wall which is made up of [Trump’s] tweets about building a wall,” she says. “It’s actually beautiful.” Adds Bodow, “He hasn’t built the wall yet, but he’s tweeted enough about the wall that you could build a wall out of the tweets [he writes about] building a wall.” The book puts a humorous lens on a presidency that is increasingly disturbing to some citizens and world leaders. RELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Writer Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack Since his inauguration in January 2017, President Trump’s Twitter feed has stirred up numerous controversies on a global scale. Recently, on July 22, he lashed out at Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani in alate-night tweet, writingan all-caps warningin response to a foreboding statement issued by the foreign leader. Addressing Rouhani directly, the president tweeted, “NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE.” Trump continued, “WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!” Trump also made headlines in January when he wrote that he has a “bigger and more powerful” nuclear button than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in a tweet that some interpreted as a threat of nuclear war. While these explosive outbursts, as well as the multiple instances in which Trump has contradicted himself on Twitter, make people wonder if the president means everything he tweets, Bodow and Flanz think he’s probably sincere. “[Trump is] either being authentic or he’s faking it better than anybody,” Bodow says. “He’s stayed in character longer than any James Franco role ever,” jokes Flanz. They add that writers forThe Daily Showare “well trained in [calling out bullshit].”The Donald J. Trump Presidential Twitter Libraryexhibit and book are just one way the show is attempting to push back against the controversial president. That’s a task that, Flanz explains, “may be our greatest challenge of all time.” “[Trump] continues to drive the political narrative literally every day now. Now that he’s the president, his Twitter feed plays a large role in determining which way the world is pointed,” Bodow says. “[Just recently, he thought,] ‘Oh, maybe we’re going to have a war with Iran now,’ because at 11:30 at night he had indigestion… This is the actual president.” The Donald J.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Cliff Sims is the latest ex-staffer in the Trump White House to speak out about his time there, in the new bookTeam of Vipers Cliff Sims isthe latest ex-stafferin the Trump White Houseto speak out about his time there. Armed with what he says are “hundreds of pages of notes” that he took during his tenure, he has writtenTeam of Vipers, out now and already quickly rebuked by PresidentDonald Trumphimself on Twitter. Sims — who was on the communications team as a special assistant to Trump until 2018 after working on Trump’s campaign — is critical of the administration even as he stands by many of its accomplishments. That dynamic extends to some his colleagues. He describes a chaotic environment, with no obvious leadership except for those in Trump’s inner circle. Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were among the privileged few, Sims writes. And while the first daughter has gathered many detractors in the years since she waded from business into politics as her father’s senior adviser, first on his campaign and then in the White House, Sims isn’t one of them. “The first time I met [Ivanka] in Trump Tower I was genuinely stunned by what appeared to be a living, breathing Barbie doll,” he writes. “I distinctly remember thinking her face didn’t appear to have a single blemish — there was nothing being covered up by makeup,” he continues. “While her critics claim she has a plastic vibe, I didn’t see her that way, though like anyone else, she could be scripted and find some topics and people more interesting than others.” Sims writes that he was “also struck by the fact that she was unfailingly polite.” Ivanka “laughed freely and had a breezy air of confidence about her,” he writes. “She could be assertive at times, but never rude. And if anyone could have gotten away with being rude, it would have been her.” RELATED:All the Memorable Moments and Missteps from Ivanka Trump’s First Year in the White House Ina Tuesday morning tweet, the president derided Sims as “a low level staffer that I hardly knew” who “wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction.” Accordingto theNew York Times, Sims left the administration last year “after clashing with” with John Kelly, then the chief of staff. White House spokespeople did not respond to a request from PEOPLE for specific comment on Sims’ account. According toTeam of Vipers, Ivanka led a group of aides determined to convince her father not to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement.They failed— a high-profile example of what Ivanka critics called a persistent inability to influence the president’s positions. They have accused her, essentially, of hypocrisy — nominally distancing herself from some of her father’s most unpopular policies but continuing to work in his White House. “He knows exactly where I stand on any issue,” shetold ABC Newsin November. “I’ll always tell you what I’m for, but it is not my place as somebody working within a White House to tell you what I’m against. The only person who knows that is one person, and he knows it.” Still, Ivanka continues to hold sway over her father, according to Sims. She has claimed victories as well, includingbacking a bipartisan bill this monthsupporting female-fronted businesses around the world. “Ivanka was and is a valuable asset to the President for one simple reason: he trusts her,” Sims writes. “He wasn’t acquiescing to her every wish, especially on policy issues. Quite the opposite, in fact. But at the very least she eased his moods and made him happy. And for a mercurial leader like Trump, that’s not nothing. No one wants the alternative.” Sims adds, “In my experience Ivanka also happened to be one of the most persuasive surrogates the President had, both in terms of selling his agenda to the public and in twisting the arms of wavering members of Congress. On tax reform, both of those talents proved valuable.” Ivanka’s White House role has long drawn scrutiny. According to some accounts, other aides have complained about the unusually secure position she and her husband hold in a turbulent West Wing. RELATED:Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner Saw Dick Cheney BiopicVicebut Left Early, Witness Says “He is my father, and he’s my boss,” Ivanka told ABC News. “And one of the reasons that I have such a good relationship with him in both a personal and professional capacity is because I’m incredibly candid with him.” According to journalist Bob Woodward’s bookFear: Trump in the White House,then-senior White House adviserSteve Bannonpurportedly exploded at her during an intense screaming match. “You’re a goddamn staffer!”Bannon yelledat Ivanka, Woodward reported. According to his book, the outburst came as Bannon was informing Ivanka that in order to talk to the president she had to go through then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus like any other staffer. “You walk around this place and act like you’re in charge, and you’re not,” Bannon reportedly said. “You’re on staff!” “I’m not a staffer! I’ll never be a staffer,” Ivanka fired back, according toFear. “I’m the first daughter.” Woodward reported that is not her only ambition: Ivanka also aspires to become thefirst woman president. While Sims doesn’t address this claim inTeam of Vipers, he does reflect on the collective cost of being in the Trump White House. His conclusion is surprisingly damning, considering that he still supports the administration. “The inner circle of Trump World was not always a pretty picture,” he writes. “Too often it was a portrait of venality, stubbornness, and selfishness. We leaked. We schemed. We backstabbed. Some of us told ourselves it was all done in the service of a higher calling — to protect the President, to deliver for the people.” “But,” Sims continues, “usually it was for ourselves. Most of us came to Washington convinced of the justice of our cause and the righteousness of our principles, certain that our moral compasses were true. But proximity to power changes that.Donald Trumpchanges that. “The once clear lines — between right and wrong, good and evil, light and darkness — were eroded until only a faint wrinkle remained.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

The eight-year-old Canadian brand has enjoyed the type of rare and rapid success companies can only dream of, and it’s because of who wears it: Everybody. And thanks to itbeing sold at some of the biggest retailers, from youth-targeted companies like Asos and Urban Outfitters toNordstromand Shopbop, it has reached full proliferation with children and grandparents alike wearing the brand. In fact, fans of Herschel have bought over 15 million products of color-blocked backpacks, wallets and now,newly launched clothing—all complete with a signature patch identifying its Herschel status. RELATED VIDEO: Back-to-School Treats fromMasterChef Junior However, the founders, brothers Jamie (below left) and Lyndon Cormack (below right), say that market domination was never the goal, though it’s a nice benefit. “We knew there was a big opportunity to come up with something that was design-driven, something that had classic it in its nature, but also had a really nice attention to detail,” Lyndon tells PEOPLE. So, in November 2009, the brothers launched their company—named after the rural Canadian town Herschel, Saskatchewan—in Vancouver, Canada with a divide-and-conquer approach: Jamie heads up design and product, while Lyndon handles marketing and sales. “We are where were at because of Jamie’s precise attention to detail and how passionate he is about design and product,” says Lyndon. “Myself, I tend to be quite a macro-thinker in relation to operations and I’m definitely motivated to say yes more than no.” RELATED: 15 Fashionable Backpacks and Totes for Your Most Stylish School Year Yet Their commitment to designing what Lyndon calls “modernized, nostalgic products” has translated into big business: They are stocked in over 10,000 places in 72 countries around the world and they employ over 170 people, including 30 dedicated solely to product design, Cormack says. (Below, a shot of the Vancouver headquarters.) Lyndon credits this success to one essential thing: “Good design is democratic,” he says. “People are going to respond to well-designed products,” he says. “We do design a little bit more specifically for the 16- to 28-year-old guy and girl. But we feel that our aesthetic is so timeless and it resonates far beyond that and it does, which is pretty amazing. When you see my mom, who is 69-years-old, carrying a Herschel, it doesn’t look out of place.” So, are they surprised by their cult following? “No,” says Lyndon. “I’m not surprised that it has resonated with so many people, but we are definitely extremely happy that we have become successful in such a short amount of time. We feel very fortunate about that.” No wonder you see those darn backpacks so often. According to the company, the three bestselling and most popular are theSettlement($59.99 to $69.99), thePop Quiz($74.99 to $84.99) and theLittle American($99.99 to $109.99) styles, pictured at the top, as well as the Novel duffle bag ($84.99 to $119.99), pictured above. However, the top-selling piece is actually not a backpack or bag at all. It’s the Charlie wallet ($19.99 to $29.99). “Most people would assume it’s the backpack, but we actually sell more wallets than anything else. It’s only $20 [average], and that might have something to do with it.” As for what the future holds, expect more of what made them famous, and universally appealing, from the beginning. Says Lyndon, “Passion is contagious and I think that if we continue to concentrate on that the future is quite bright.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: President Trump‘s former campaign manager Paul Manafort turned himself in to the FBI on Monday afterbeing charged with money laundering, tax fraud and conspiracy against the United States. Manafort’s alleged crimes have piqued the interest of almost everyone —except apparently Fox News— but especially computer security researchers who worked to uncoverManafort’s James Bond-inspired email password: “bond007.” It wasn’t hard for researchers to crack that case. According to Business Insider, the not-so-subtle password hints Manafort set up for his Adobe account included “secret agent” and “James Bond.” And since Manafort broke the cardinal rule of internet passwords — using the same one for multiple accounts — researchers were also able to access Manafort’s Dropbox account using the same “bond007” password. The puzzle first presented itself in February, after hackers broke into Manafort’s daughter’s iPhone and published about 300,000 of her alleged text messages to the dark web. Among those messages was Manafort’s former email address, uncovered by a security researcher who goes by the online name Krypt3ia. (Manafort told Politico in February thathackers had successfully broken into his daughter’s phoneand confirmed the authenticity of some of the texts between him and her, but declined to comment on most of them.) Another researcher found that accounts using Manafort’s email address were compromised in two major security hacks: the 2013 Adobe hack, and the 2012 Dropbox hack, Business Insider said. The Trump administration has sought to downplay Manafort’s role in the 2016 campaign in the wake of his indictment, with Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying Monday, “Paul Manafort was brought in to lead the delegate process, which he did, and was dismissed not too long after that [in August].” But the leaked text messages sent and received by Manafort’s daughter Andrea Manafort Shand suggest that her father’s influence with Trump extended far beyond what he and his administration have claimed. Even after Manafort stepped down from the campaign last August amid reports of his ties to Russia, Manafort Shand told friends that her father was still one of Trump’s closest “allies.” “As I suspected, my dad resigned from being the public face of the campaign but is still very much involved behind the scenes,” Manafort Shand texted a friend in August. “He felt he was becoming a distraction and that would ultimately take a toll on the campaign.” RELATED VIDEO: Paul Manafort and Another Former Trump Aide Have Been Charged in Mueller’s Russia Probe Manafort Shand also described her father as being “super tight” with the entire Trump family and “one of the world’s greatest manipulators.” “Like he just tells you the sky is green over and over,” she said. “And eventually you are like is it? … It’s confidence. When you say something unwaveringly, people start to believe it.” “I mean yea that got Trump where he is today,” a friend replied. “Yup. Perfect allies,” Manafort Shand agreed. “Trump probably has more morals than my dad. Which is really just saying something about my dad. My dad is a psycho!!!” Manafort Shand also claimed that her father’s role in Trump’s campaign was generally much greater than the public was led to believe and that Manafort was responsible for choosing Mike Pence as Trump’s vice president and for hiring Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon. Manafort Shand told sister Jessica Manafort that their father “was brought on to be convention manager, but really it was always to run s–t.” Manafort has denied “knowingly�? colluding with Russian operativesduring the 2016 campaign. He also previously denied “financial wrongdoing regarding his Ukraine-related payments, his bank accounts in offshore tax shelters and his various real-estate transactions over the years,” CNN reported. Manafort pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday. He was released on $10 million bond and placed on house arrest, per the Associated Press. Manafort’s lawyer, Keith Downing, told reporters outside the courthouse that “there’s no evidence that Mr. Manafort or the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Ina press release, the university confirmed the fatal incident and identified the victims as Valeria Espinel and Olivia Lara Rojas, who were both 19-year-old first-year students. A third student, who was a sophomore — identified by the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office (SJCPO) as 19-year-old Eduardo Jose Elias Calderon — was also struck by the vehicle but is currently hospitalized, according to the university. \"On behalf of the entire Notre Dame community, I express our deepest condolences and pray that our students’ families and friends may find God’s grace and solace after so shattering a loss,\" University of Notre Dame President Rev. John I. Jenkins said in a statement. \"We also pray for a full recovery of our student who remains hospitalized as a result of the accident.\" According to a press release from the SJCPO, the incident unfolded on Saturday morning just after 4 a.m. local time. Authorities said a Toyota Sienna minivan was traveling southbound on Ironwood Road when it struck three individuals. According toThe South Bend Tribune,the road that the individuals were walking on does not have sidewalks and is near an apartment complex where many Notre Dame upperclassmen and graduate students live. RELATED:2 College Students Killed, 3 Others Injured in Texas Car Crash: 'Horrible Loss of Life' After hitting the trio, the minivan made a \"sharp left,\" collided with a house on the 54000 block of Ironwood Road and came to a stop against the front of the residence, the SJCPO's press release stated. The owner of the house toldThe Tribunethat he was sleeping at the time of the crash but felt the car come through his bedroom wall. \"I heard the boom, felt the house shake and heard stuff fall off the wall,\" said the man, who did not want to disclose his identity, adding that he called 911 and then went outside to see what had occurred. Meanwhile, as the victims were lying in the roadway, SJCPO authorities said a second vehicle, a Chevrolet Impala, was traveling southbound on Ironwood Road and ended up striking Espinel again. Both female victims — Rojas of Bolivia and Espinel of Ecuador — were pronounced dead at the scene, while Calderon of the Dominican Republic was transported to Memorial Hospital in South Bend, where he remains in critical condition, according to police. As for the drivers, the SJCPO said the Sienna was being operated by Justin Cavallo of South Bend. Cavallo, 25, suffered minor injuries but remained at the scene and cooperated with investigators. He also had a passenger inside the vehicle, whom police identified as Rafik Tannir of South Bend. Tannir, 24, was uninjured in the incident. RELATED VIDEO: 6-Year-Old Girl In Indiana Is Killed In A Car Crash The driver of the Impala, Darlene Holden of South Bend, also did not suffer any injuries.

Weinstein, 67, was found guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree and acquitted on three other charges, according toThe New York Times. Chapman, 43, who married the disgraced producer in 2007 and announced their split in 2017, has kept a low-profile since he was accused of victimizing more than 80 women. The two reached a divorce settlement in January 2018. The fashion designer and Marchesa co-founder has two young children with Weinstein: India, 9, and Dashiell, 6. Chapman announced she was leaving Weinstein in October 2017 saying in a statement obtained by PEOPLE at the time, “My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions.” Weinstein will pay Chapman a divorce agreement worth roughly $15 to 20 million,a source told PEOPLE in 2018.Chapman will also get primary custody of their two children. RELATED:Harvey Weinstein Found Guilty on Rape and Sex Assault Charges “I have chosen to leave my husband,” she said. “Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.” A source told PEOPLE at the time the fashion designer was “very, very upset.” “Georgina is very loved. Many people very much care about her. She won’t be going through this alone,” the source said. “It was her decision to separate. For every day, it was an easier decision for her to make. She was very honest when she released the statement about how her heart breaks for all the women who have suffered. She can’t imagine their pain. She feels sick and very sad that her husband is the cause. She is focusing on Her kids and business.” Chapman’s business is the Marchesa fashion brand that she co-founded in 2004 with Keren Craig. The label immediately became known for princess-like red carpet-worthy designs featuring bold embellishments, romantic fabrics and dramatic floral accents.

Chapman has received the continued support of A-list actresses such asScarlett JohanssonandPriyanka Chopra Jonas, who haveboth worn Marchesa designson the red carpet in the wake of the scandal. The designerspoke out for the first timeabout the allegations against her ex in a May 2018Vogueinterview. “There was a part of me that was terribly naive — clearly,sonaive. I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief,” she said. “And I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be? What are people going to say to them? It’s like, theylovetheir dad. They love him. I just can’t bear it for them.” Chapman told the magazine she “never” knew of Weinstein’s alleged behavior, making the revelations more shocking. “That’s what makes this so incredibly painful: I had what I thought was a very happy marriage. I loved my life,” she said. “I was so humiliated and so broken… that… I, I, I… didn’t think it wasrespectfulto go out.” She continued, “I thought, ‘Who am I to be parading around with all of this going on?’ It’s still so very, very raw. I was walking up the stairs the other day and I stopped; it was like all the air had been punched out of my lungs.” RELATED:Georgina Chapman ‘Will Never Take’ Harvey Weinstein Back But Is Still in Contact, Says Source TheVoguearticle also revealed Chapman had become “super tight” to Huma Abedin — the Hillary Clinton aide and ex of disgraced politician Anthony Weiner, who was convicted of sexting a minorand served an 18-month jail sentence. “We just… bonded,” Abedin told the magazine. “Inallllkinds of ways. This particular club, ironically, it’s not such a small one: women who have had to endure it in such a public way, women like Georgina and me.” Abedin added, “People don’t feel sorry for us; you don’t that empathy. People think you’re beautiful, you’re thin, you’re rich, you’re photographed on the red carpet, and you get stuck in this category.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: \"Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis,' Jacob Frey responded. \"We are strong as hell\" At a news conference in the pre-dawn hours on Friday, Minneapolis MayorJacob Freyslammed his left hand on his podium while responding to PresidentDonald Trump's pointed criticism Thursday night, as protests and riots over the death ofGeorge Floydcontinued to roil the Minnesota city. Floyd died after a police officer knelt with his knee on Floyd's neck for minutes while arresting him Monday, even as Floyd pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Video of the arrest, which seemingly shows Floyd falling unconscious, has sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country this week. Tensions escalated Thursday night when a police precinct was lit on fire and the president responded on Twitter, saying he'd send in the military and \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" (Twitter hid that message, saying it glorified violence.) Trump also directed blame at Frey, a Democrat who the president has targeted online before. Hetweetedthat Minneapolis had a \"total lack of leadership\" and called on Frey to \"get his act together and bring the City under control.\" Frey, speaking to reporters shortly before 2 a.m. on Friday, bubbled over in visible frustration as a reporter read Trump's tweet to him. “Let me say this: Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else at a time of crisis,” Frey, 38, fired back. \"Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. This is a difficult time, yes, but you better be damn sure that we’re going to get through this.\" Trump targeted Frey last October after the president's re-election campaign alleged the city of Minneapolis was price-gouging the Trump campaign, who held a rally at the city's Target Center on Oct. 10. The campaign complained Frey, labeled a \"left-winger resister,\" and Minneapolis were hiking the cost for providing security at the arena and Frey was allegedly \"abusing his power in an attempt to block the president's supporters from seeing him speak.\" “To say the least, it’s a strange feeling to wake up in the morning to the president of the United States tweeting about our city and me as the mayor,” FreytoldPoliticolast year. “Probably no one outside of Minnesota knew who Mayor Jacob Frey was before this week, and Donald Trump just elevated his profile in a major way,” Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer–Labor Party, told Politico then. RELATED:Taylor Swift Slams Donald Trump for 'Threatening Violence' in Response to George Floyd Protests Frey, a former collegiate track athlete, quickly elevated his own political profile in the years after moving to Minneapolis in 2009 following a marathon there. The budding politician relocated to the city from his native Virginia, according to a 2019W Magazine profile, and won a seat on the city council in 2013. Five years later, he was sworn in as the city's mayor. He announced in March that he and his second wife, Sarah Clarke, a local lobbyist, wereexpecting their first child togethercome September. His at-home announcement came less than a week after the city went into astate of emergencyamid thenovel coronavirus pandemic. Frey has called for the four former police officers involved in Floyd's arrest to be criminally charged and said Tuesday their firing was \"the right call.\" \"If most people, particularly people of color, had done what a police officer did late Monday, they’d already be behind bars,\" Frey, an attorney who graduated from Villanova Law School in 2009,tweetedWednesday, a day before Trump lashed out at local leaders and protesters in Minneapolis. \"We can’t turn a blind eye.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The decisions left President Donald Trump fuming on Twitter on Thursday even though his attorneys say they aren't done fighting In a move that left PresidentDonald Trumpfuming on Twitter on Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled against him in two cases over whether his personal financial records should be turned over to investigators — a New York prosecutor's office, in one case, and Congress' Democratic majority in another. But the decisions, handed down on Thursday, do not mean Trump's finances will be made public any time soon. If and when the records are obtained — either by congress committee or a New York grand jury — it would be for the purpose of investigation, not officially for public consumption (though the court did not ignore the possibility of a leak). Rather, taking a broad view of the president's obligations under the law, the Supreme Court dismissed Trump's range of arguments about why his personal records shouldn't be subpoenaed by various committees in the House of Representatives or by New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance. \"In our judicial system, 'the public has a right to every man’s evidence.' Since the earliest days of the Republic, 'every man' has included the President of the United States,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in one of the two majority opinions on Trump's records. Justice Brett Kavanaugh concurred: \"In our system of government, as this court has often stated, no one is above the law. That principle applies, of course, to a president.\" \"Two hundred years ago, a great jurist of our Court established that no citizen, not even the President, is categorically above the common duty to produce evidence when called upon in a criminal proceeding,\" Roberts wrote. \"We reaffirm that principle today.\" In the other case, he wrote: \"Legislative inquiries might involve the President in appropriate cases; as noted, Congress’s responsibilities extend to 'every affair of government.' \" Both cases were decided by a seven-to-two vote, with both Trump-appointed justices — including Kavanaugh — in the majority. Roberts delivered the opinions. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented. The president is exceedingly tight-lipped about the particulars of his business dealings, which are anchored around the family's privately held Trump Organization. The Trumps have argued that scrutiny about their money amounts to rumor-mongering and organized harassment — \"POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!\" as the president put it ina Thursday tweet. A chorus of critics, however, say that Trump has hidden his finances (including his tax returns) like no other modern president, making it impossible to know what behind-closed-door deals he's made and to whom he may be secretly indebted, including foreign businesses. In the New York case, the Supreme Court paved the way for prosecutors to obtain the requested financial documents via a grand jury subpoena there, as part of a probe into hush-money payments and other matters. A lower court ruling in the dispute was affirmed and the case was remanded in order to proceed, with the possibility Trump could make another objection before the subpoena is enforced. (His lawyers soon said they would do just that.) In the case of the House subpoenas, the court sent the matter back to the lower courts with clearer guidance on how to rule, agreeing that while Congress did have some authority here it should be subject to certain scrutinies and limitations given the separation of powers between the presidency and legislature. The subpoenas in both cases were to either Deutsche Bank, where Trump does business, or his accounting firm, Mazars USA. Those companies said they would have complied until the president intervened,according to NPR. “A careful reading of the Supreme Court rulings related to the President’s financial records is not good news for President Trump,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement, adding: “The Court has reaffirmed the Congress’s authority to conduct oversight on behalf of the American people, as it asks for further information from the Congress. Congress’s constitutional responsibility to uncover the truth continues.\" In a separate statement, the New York County district attorney said,according toThe New York Times: \"This is a tremendous victory for our nation’s system of justice and its founding principle that no one — not even a president — is above the law. Our investigation, which was delayed for almost a year by this lawsuit, will resume, guided as always by the grand jury’s solemn obligation to follow the law and the facts, wherever they may lead.\" The president's attorney, Jay Sekulow, said the fight continues. “We are pleased that in the decisions issued today, the Supreme Court has temporarily blocked both Congress and New York prosecutors from obtaining the president’s tax records,” he said in a statement, according to theTimes.“We will now proceed to raise additional constitutional and legal issues in the lower courts.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Windsor – dominated by the oldest inhabited castle in the world — is a royal town like no other. It gives its name to the family now headed by King Charles III and is the scene of some of the most memorable (and sometimes most moving) spectacles in recent history. Now,Prince WilliamandKate Middletonare making it home with their young family. \"Like the late Queen and King Charles, they are outdoorsy people,\" says Natasha Daniel of the town's Daniel department store. \"It's been a strange year,\" she adds. \"We were celebrating the Jubilee in June and obviously we recently had the saddest news. Most people in Windsor are very active monarchists. You would sometimes see the Queen's corgis being walked, and you almost thought she would be around forever. Windsor without her is a strange place. This now feels a strange in-between time.\" At the Duchess of Cambridge pub, staff are used to people visiting with hopes of seeing a royal. The pub was renamed shortly after the wedding of Kate to William in 2011. Now, the company that owns it is mulling over changing its name to the Princess of Wales in the light of Kate's new title. Tionne Mingle, 19, pours a pint of Mac's IPA — one of the McMullen brewery's signature beers — across the bar from a huge framed poster of the then-Prince Charlesin the pub years ago. \"Prince Charlesreaching for another McMullen's ale\" is the caption in bold type. Next to it, is a small framed shot of William and Kate. \"We have people from all over the world — from Australia, Canada and the Commonwealth countries — coming in here and some ask if we have seen Kate and William,\" says assistant manager Tel Fernandes. \"It's lovely that they've moved in nearby. The name of this pub definitely draws people here. I live above it and every time I look out of the front window, I see people taking pictures.\" People flocked to Windsor both after the Queen's death and around the day of her committal service — and royal pilgrims are still arriving to view her resting place at St. George's Chapel within the castle grounds. About 100 yards from the main castle gate is Ajit Sandhu's store that he's run for 31 years. \"A lot of people came on the saddest day. It was so busy here after the Queen died, as people came here to remember her,\" Sandhu says. He adds that Kate and William are not necessarily on peoples' minds in his store. \"At the moment, not many people ask about them, as it's all about the Queen. People come here knowing that the royals are often seen in Windsor on special occasions and events and ask if we see the Kate in the streets.\" The 71-year-old adds, \"It's good for the town that they have moved to the estate. It's good to have a presence here.\" \"A lot of people would like to see William as the king, but that is not how it goes,\" says Sandhu. \"People will forget things that happened years and years ago. They move on, which is a good thing. At the end of the day, [Charles] is our King.\" Assistant Laura Gray is arranging some displays inMartyn Crossley, the Floristshop in the heart of Windsor. It is quieter this early autumn day, compared to the week between the Queen's death and funeral, when hundreds of people ordered flowers to lay at the gates of the castle grounds. Embassies from around the world, including Malta, the British Virgin Islands, Peru, Chile, the Falkland Islands and Sudan and the President of Austria, got in touch to send flowers to St. George's Chapel. Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, and her daughters,Princess BeatriceandPrincess Eugenie, are customers — the family sent a white bouquet of flowers up to Balmoral Castle on the Sunday before the Queen died. Florist Martyn Crossley created the bouquet and the table decorations of roses, freesias and stock that was presented to the Queen when she carried out her last public engagement at a hospice near Windsor in July. \"People here just get on with it,\" Crossley says of the royal family's presence. \"Catherine and William were here last week, seeing people at the Guildhall, and people just take it for granted. It's the tourists that get excited about seeing them! There is a feel-good factor about them being here.\" Windsor feels like a different place since the Queen died on Sept. 8. \"I still can't believe it. I keep thinking she's just in Balmoral and will be back,\" says Crossley. \"Living in Windsor, you always look up at the castle, and you might see the Royal Standard flying and would think, 'Oh, she's at home.' And you'd feel comfort with that. I presume things are going to be different now.\" In 1901, the year that Queen Victoria died,Danieldepartment store was born. Walter James Daniel was the first owner – and 121 years later, his great-great-granddaughter Natasha Daniel shows PEOPLE around the award-winning first floor toy section. There, standing life-size tall at more than 5 ft. is a Lego sentry, while in another section a huge stuffed toy lion prowls above the boxes of goodies. It's a treasure trove for children — let alone royal ones. \"I know they visit John Lewis in Sloane Square in London, so it's likely they'd come here too,\" Natasha says. \"It's a kid's dream. When I was little, I used to come in here and it all felt so big, with all your favorite toys from my wildest dreams!\" She says people in the town think the Wales family will move from Adelaide Cottage to Windsor Castle itself eventually. \"It's great that they are here,\" she says. In the women's section, familiar brands like country favorite Barbour and Radley accessories vie for attention with Tommy Hilfiger. Sophie, Countess of Wessex visited a few years ago, and Princess Anne has also been spotted in the store. ButPrince Williamand Kate are helping renew the royals' connection with this most royal of towns. \"It's a new life for them, and it's all part of the circle of life. People pass and babies are born,\" Natasha says. The store had a royal warrant for the provision of gifts to the royal household, and the crest is proudly displayed on the front of the building. But, like all warrants, it ended with the Queen's passing. They can keep it active on their letterheads and the building for two years, and they hope it will be renewed by King Charles. Nimia (which means \"come to me\") is a little Scilian café on the walk from Windsor to Eton, just over the bridge that links the two. Specializing in delicious cannoli sweet treats, it also serves brownies and pastries. Barista Ilaria Bertuetti says, \"This is a lovely quiet area – there are parks and the River Thames, but it is still close to London too. You never know if they are walking the dog by the river with the children. It would be good to come here. If she does, I will tell you!\" Situated very close to the road out of the estate, the Windsor Farm Shop — with its 21-day aged pure bred Sussex beef and lamb from nearby Bagshot Park farm — is effectively on the royals' doorstep. There are local organic vegetables, pots of Acacia honey (complete with honeycomb) and bottles of the estate's fine sparkling wine for sale. Kate stands in line at the local butcher's shop when she is in Norfolk, and there's every chance she will do the same here. Prince Williamwould cross the bridge from Eton into Windsor on Sundays when he was a student at Eton College to spend some time with his grandmother as she helped prepare him with the wisdom of her vast royal experience. He and his brother,Prince Harry, would row on the Thames between the two towns during afternoons of sport at the prestigious college.Prince William's boarding home, Manor House, was a comfort away from the frequent media storms and turmoil caused by the news of their parents' unhappy marriage.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Wade, an activist, writerandpoet, tells PEOPLE that she is \"inspired\" by the 22-year-old Gorman, not only as a fellow creative, but as a woman of color. \"I'm proud of and inspired by Amanda,\" theWhere to Beginauthor, 31, says. \"What is so incredible about her is not only her gifts and her talents and the ways that she is able to name so beautifully and incredibly what she sees around her, being in this country ... but because she exists and she is the age she is and writes the type of things she writes, it's giving an entire generation of young Black and brown girls excitement about using their voice.\" Gorman, who was named the country's first National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017, was handpicked by First Lady Dr. Jill Biden to read a piece during President Joe Biden's inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20. RELATED:Amanda Gorman Signs with IMG Models a Week After Reciting Inspiring Poem at the Inauguration With herpowerful reading of \"The Hill We Climb\"during the event, Gorman, who recently gracedthe cover ofTime, captivated viewers around the world as she became just the sixth poet to read a piece at a presidential inauguration,accordingto the Academy of American Poets. The inaugural reading turned the poet into an overnight sensation, leading to her also becoming the first person to recite a poem at the Super Bowl and landing hera contract with IMG Models. Wade — who also supported the Biden election campaign by collaborating with Meena Harrison an inspiring graphic tee designin honor of Vice President Kamala Harris — says that she only expects Gorman's bright light to continue to grow as she uses the \"beauty of poetry\" to help the next generation find their voice. \"And I only hope for her to get bigger and bigger and rise more and more, and for us to fall deeper and deeper into appreciation of her, because she's not only opening the doors for so many other young women of color, but she's also opening the minds of so many women of color,\" Wade says.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: PEOPLE’s Voices from the Fight Against Racism will amplify perspectives on the push for equality and justice A Black actress, activist, author and vocalist,Donzaleigh Abernathygrew up on the front lines of the civil rights movement. (She delivered her first public speech when she was just 12, at Washington D.C.'sChildren for Survival March in 1972.) Her father,Rev. Dr. Ralph David Abernathy, wasRev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s best friend and closest advisor — King once wrote that \"The people loved and respected [Ralph] as a symbol of courage and strength.\" The two men were jailed together 17 times, according to Stanford University'sMartin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute. Donzaleigh also happens to be King's goddaughter. In 2004, Donzaleigh wrotePartners To History, Martin Luther King, Ralph David Abernathy and the Civil Rights Movement, which was nominated as one of the Best Books for Young Adults by the American Library Association, and she was a contributing author for the Smithsonian Institute'sbook In the Spirit of Martin. In addition to along career in TV and film acting, Donzaleigh lends her voice as thelead soloist on \"The Listening\"(releasing Feb. 12), a unique social-justice chorus project inspired by Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1967 speech, \"Beyond Vietnam: A Time To Break Silence\" (delivered exactly one year before his murder). \"The Listening\" was commissioned for theVOICES21C choirand arranged bycomposer Cheryl B. Engelhardt. In addition to Donzaleigh, it features Black activists likeHalim Flowers(who was wrongfully imprisoned for murder for 22 years),Wes Feltonand more. This is Donzaleigh Abernathy's story, as told to PEOPLE. I was born in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1957, during the era of segregation. Months before I was born, when my mother was pregnant with me, she was home alone with my toddler sister. My father was in Atlanta with Uncle Martin [Luther King Jr.] and Aunt Coretta [Scott King] for the first organizational meeting ofthe Southern Christian Leadership Conference. My mother had fallen asleep while watching the late-nightJack Paar Show. Fifteen minutes after she woke up and went to her bedroom, the front of the house exploded. My mother told me I was born trembling. She said, \"You literally shook for six months.\" In utero, I had taken on her trauma. Once, while we were living in Montgomery, my sister and I were playing in the backyard when three or four police officers came up and just stood there, silently watching us from beyond the yard. It's a moment I've never forgotten. My mother came flying out the back door, yelling, \"Don't hurt my children!\" The Movement We moved to Atlanta when I was 4. Uncle Martin and his family had moved there the year before, and he called every day until he convinced my parents to move, too. My father and Uncle Martin were best friends. They first met when my father was in graduate school, earning his master's degree in sociology. They reconnected a few years later when Uncle Martin came to Montgomery, and they were both young ministers with wives. People sometimes say my father, Ralph Abernathy, was Martin Luther King's \"chief aide.\" But he wasn't — they did everything together in the movement. They shared the same hotel rooms and shared time with their families. Uncle Martin was the voice and the face; my father was the planner, the strategist, keeping everyone together. After suffering an assassin's bullet,Uncle Martin diedin my father's arms at St. Joseph Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. In Montgomery, the Ku Klux Klan called us twice a day, but after we moved to Atlanta, they would only call during dinner, at a time when others would telephone us from the church or the movement. Invariably, when the call came, Mother would slam the phone down. It was always terrifying — they threatened to kill us. The movement was thrilling to experience as a little girl. Our home was the primary meeting place for Uncle Martin and my father. I remember theFreedom Riders coming to our house; I remember waking in the morning and seeing these Black and white young adults sleeping on pallets in our living room. That was my earliest memory of the late CongressmanJohn Lewis, whom I grew up knowing and loving all my life. Freedom was stressed so much; we wanted to be free. That's what they used to say in their chants: \"What do we want? Freedom! When do we want it? Now!\" RELATED:Read More of PEOPLE's Voices from the Fight Against RacismandBlack History MonthStories When I was around 5 years old, Dad told usMedgar Evershad been killed in his driveway. He told us the day would come when he believed something would happen to him; we had to be prepared. It was a difficult reality to accept as a child, but it was our reality. There were incredibly glorious times, too, such as marching on the front line of the Selma to Montgomery March for the right to vote, and attending the March on Washington. Professional Highs & Lows I started acting in the Christmas and Easter plays we'd put on for our parents and Yolanda King's acting teacher, Walter Roberts. (Yolanda King was Uncle Martin's eldest child.) At Emerson College in Boston, I met my Shakespeare teacher, Dr.William Sharp, and my mentor,Vincent Murphy. I graduated in 1980 and wanted to go to London to be a theater actress. But the head of the Royal Academy, where I auditioned, told me to come back the following year because they already had their one Black student for the year. I was crushed. Back in Atlanta, I was given the chance to work on a movie withRuth Gordon, an older Hollywood movie star and screenwriter — and the star ofHarold and Maude.Miss Gordon's husband, Garson Kanin, wanted me to be her dresser, to accompany her everywhere and watch her on set. While we waited in the trailer, Ruthie taught me the craft of screen acting and how to warm up before going on camera. She said, \"I don't want you to be so self-effacing. I want you to stand up for yourself, young lady.\" I've been blessed with great teachers:Stella Adler, Milton Katselas, Judith Weston. I was one of the actors Stella worked with in front of her last master class of about 500 students. She gave me a solid foundation. I've enjoyed a wonderful career, though it was much busier when I was younger and prettier. I've been auditioning during the pandemic while also writing my second book and working as an actor, writer, public speaker and singer. \"The Listening\" My husband,Dar Dixon, first heard about Cheryl Engelhardt's new choral project. It was based on Uncle Martin's speech against the War in Vietnam. I was completely blown away as I listened to it at a concert; it was different from anything I'd ever heard. It reminded me of an opera, ofHamilton. Afterwards, when we met Cheryl, I spoke about my older sister Juandalynn, who sings opera and classical music in Germany. When Cheryl decided to make a recording of the song, my husband insisted she hear me sing. Cheryl said she wanted me to perform the solo. All our parts were recorded separately, but the voices were put together to form a chorus, and the video was arranged like a Zoom. Cheryl is extremely talented, a great composer. I'm so excited for her future and am honored that I could sing the solo. Inspirations An up-and-comer who gives me hope for the future isAmanda Gorman, our young poet Laureate. I first met Amanda and her twin sister Gabrielle when they attendedNew Roads School, where I'm a founding member on the Board of Trustees. I got to know them because I would speak there every year for Martin Luther King Day. I'm so inspired by her; when I watched the inauguration, I found myself literally crying tears of joy. I also love George Clooney, not only because he's a brilliant actor and director, but because he's politically savvy and uses his celebrity for good. That's what I saw growing up: movie stars like Marlon Brando, Paul Newman, Harry Belafonte, Sammy Davis, Jr., and my hero Sidney Poitier at the March On Washington, plus author James Baldwin and actresses Lena Horne, Rita Moreno, Diahann Carroll and Josephine Baker. I knew it was dangerous to lead a movement like Daddy and Uncle Martin, but I'm an artist, so I said, \"Okay, then I'll be like these movie stars — like Marlon Brando.\" You can make movies while still being socially minded and politically active, donating to causes and marching on the front lines for freedom. Racism in America America has come a long way in my lifetime, but we still have further to go. The re-emergence of the white supremacy movement has been a temporary setback; it's sought to divide America. But it will fail again, because it is rooted in racial hatred and religious hatred. These days, I can wake up and not be gripped with fear. For four years of the previous administration, I listened as my elderly mother worried that everything she, my father, Uncle Martin, Aunt Coretta and countless others had endured for us to have fundamental human and civil rights might be taken away. Having been born and raised amid the constant threat of death from white supremacists, the reemergence of racial intolerance advocated by the previous administration brought back memories of that trauma. When the insurrection occurred at the Capitol, I saw a photograph of one of the terrorists seated at Madam Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk. I was horrified. I looked to the left and saw my father's face on a plaque by the window withJames Foreman, Uncle Martin,Reverend Jesse Douglasand John Lewis as they marched for the right to vote in Montgomery, in 1965. RELATED:These 5 Steps Towards Anti-Racism Begin with Living Values Out Loud, Writes Activist Brea Baker I immediately felt personally violated. All I could hear was my father. He was very clear in teaching us African-American history from the very beginning of our lives. He used to tell us about a Black man named Crispus Attucks, the first person to die in Boston Commons [Attucks was thefirst casualty of the American Revolution in 1770]. When people stand up for civil rights and human rights, we're not being unpatriotic. We're being patriotic. We're asking Americans to live up to the principles upon which our nation was founded: that all men and women are created equal and are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. We need to go to the Heartland across America — Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Missouri, North and South Dakota, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Kansas — and let people know they don't need to be afraid of people of color, people from different religions, people seeking gender or sexual equality or people from the LGBTQ community. My father use to say, \"We hate each other because we fear each other. We fear each other because we don't know each other. We don't know each other because we won't sit down at the table together. Let us sit down at the table together and break bread.\" We have to meet hate with love. Uncle Martin use to say, \"You have to love those you don't like. Love those whose ways don't move. Love every man because God loves them.\" — As told toLaura Barcella To help combat systemic racism, consider learning from or donating to these organizations:\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

In a Twitter thread posted Thursday,Frost detailed his questto find an apartment in the U.S. capital, saying he was denied due to bad credit. \"Just applied to an apartment in DC where I told the guy that my credit was really bad. He said I'd be fine,\" Frost wrote. \"Got denied, lost the apartment, and the application fee. This ain't meant for people who don't already have money.\" In later tweets, Frost shared that his bad credit was largely the result of his congressional run, writing: \"For those asking, I have bad credit cause I ran up a lot of debt running for Congress for a year and a half. Didn't make enough money from Uber itself to pay for my living.\" \"It isn't magic that we won our very difficult race,\" Frost continued. \"For that primary, I quit my full time job cause I knew that to win at 25 yrs old, I'd need to be a full time candidate. 7 days a week, 10-12 hours a day. It's not sustainable or right but it's what we had to do.\" But as Frost noted in further tweets, campaign law dictates that candidates cannot legally give themselves a stipend until the end of their campaigns — which means that unless they are independently wealthy to begin with, most politicians find themselves losing money early on. \"As a candidate, you can't give yourself a stipend or anything till the very end of your campaign. So most of the run, you have no $ coming in unless you work a second job,\" Frost wrote.

In an interview withTheNewYorkTimes, she noted that she couldn't really \"take a salary\" in the interim period after being elected but before taking office. \"I have three months without a salary before I'm a member of Congress,\" Ocasio-Cortez told theTimes. \"So, how do I get an apartment?

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: As House Republicanstried this week(and then backed down in the face of public outrage) to weaken the nonpartisan office in charge of investigating lawmaker and staff misconduct, PEOPLE took a look back at some of the most eyebrow-raising ways public and campaign funds have been used by politicians. When official spending takes a turn for the personal—and, sometimes, downright weird—it’s not always illegal. But, even it doesn’t lead to jail time, it can ruin careers. 1. Flights for a family rabbit. When traveling on the campaign trail, sometimes you need to bring the whole family along with you. And for California Representative Duncan Hunter, that includes his family’s pet rabbit. During a review of his practices, the House Office of Congressional Ethics uncovered $600 of campaign funds spent on rabbit air travel, reportsthe San Diego Union Tribune. That’s just a drop in the bucket: He’s previously spent $62,000 of campaign money on oral surgery, video games, resort vacations and jewelry buys. All $62,000 has been reimbursed, and a spokesman for Hunter, Joe Kasper,toldYahoo Newsthat there was “no intent” to misuse campaign funds. 2. A Downton Abbey-inspired office. Former Illinois representative Aaron Schock has been in the spotlight for a few reasons: First, he posed shirtless on the cover ofMen’s Health. Second, he became the first member of Congress to take decorating cues fromDownton Abbey,with red paint, gilt sconces and old-fashioned portraits covering the walls of his House office suite on Capitol Hill. At first, it was a bit of a joke to Shock, until a watchdog group filed a complaint.He then said he’d pay for the decorations himself. “Once it’s done, I’m sure I will get an invoice as I did before, and we’ll pay,” he said. “As Taylor Swift said, �?Haters gonna hate.’” That was just his first issue with alleged fund misuse… 3. Workout DVDs. Schock didn’t learn his lesson there, it seemed. A later investigation alleged that he had misused government money and campaign funds on a number of things, including private flights, a car, Super Bowl tickets and even workout DVDs. He was later accused oftrying to get the federal government to reimburse him for miles driven on his car— except he allegedly lied about the number of miles, according to documents published byPolitico. In the aftermath of this scandal,he resigned his seat on March 17, 2015. He was indicted in November 2016 and plead not guilty. This was all before the age of 35. 3. Golf tournament fees. Before he was the vice president-elect, before he was governor of Indiana, before he was even a congressman, Mike Pence was a candidate. Back in 1990, he came under fire for (then, legally) using political donations to make payments on his home mortgage, his personal credit card and his wife’s car,The Washington Postreported.He also used the money to pay fees associated with entry into golf tournaments. After the election, Pence went on an “apology tour” around the state of Indiana and promised not to engage in such practices again, calling it “an exercise in naivety.” 4. Dry cleaning. Though this pales in comparison toAnthony Weiner’s other scandals, in December 2016, he was found to have spent campaign funds on personal purchases. That included $1,500 of dry cleaning and cell phone bills, according toDNAInfo.While the New York City Campaign Finance Board has ordered him to pay the $195,377 back (plus a $65,000 fine), it’s just a blip on the radar of his derailed political career. 5. Weekend home renovations. Former Connecticut Governor John Rowland has been to prison twice. While he’s currently serving his second sentence, the first came after a criminal investigation for using government contractors to renovate his vacation home, a claim he initially denied, before taking a plea deal and resigning in disgrace. 6. Massages and trips to the spa. Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick racked up plenty of personal charges on his city-issued credit card, including dinners out, pricey bottles of wine and trips to the spa, according to theNew York Times. Keep in mind, the man was the mayor when Detroit had an estimated deficit of $230 million. He paid back just $9,000 of the $210,000 in credit card charges. He’s currently serving out a 28-year jail sentence for non-related charges. 7. Salaries for your kids. Former Illinois Governor George Ryan spent six years in prison after a lengthy trial, which, yes, involved misuse of campaign funds. According to theChicago Tribune,Ryan’s children and other relatives were given hefty payments (one to his son-in-law amounted to $55,000, theTribunereported) from campaign coffers though they did minimal work for the campaign. Though his five daughters managed to avoid the witness stand, they did testify about these gifts through written statements, theChicago Sun-Timesreported.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Either Biden or Sanders needs at least 1,991 delegates to win the Democratic Party's nomination and go on to face Donald Trump in November's election Former Vice PresidentJoe Bideneasily won at least three of the six states that voted Tuesday in the Democratic Party’spresidential contest: Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri. Multiple news outlets declared him victorious not long after polls began closing there. His wide margin in Michigan, in particular, delivered a significant strategic and symbolic blow to Vermont Sen.Bernie Sanders‘ hopes of turning the race for the Democratic nomination into a protracted head-to-head. With votes still to be counted, Biden held double-digit margins over Sanders in Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri as of late Tuesday. In the latter two states, he was winning by about 65 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The other states voting Tuesday — Idaho, North Dakota and Washington — are further west and had only just begun reporting results given the time change. Sanders had an early lead in North Dakota while Biden was leading in Idaho. Washington was a much closer contest. Either Biden or Sanders needs at least 1,991 total delegates to win the Democratic nomination this summer and go on to face PresidentDonald Trumpin November’s election. So far, Biden has 783 delegates to Sanders’ 628,according toThe New York Times. With many states still to vote in the next three months, it remains unclear how exactly the remainder of the primary race will play out. But Sanders’ path to success narrows by the day. FollowingBiden’s big wins on “Super Tuesday” last week, he has now established a commanding lead over Sanders in both votes and delegates in seeking the Democratic nomination. RELATED:Who Is Winning the Democratic Primary Sanders had won in New Hampshire and Nevada, two early states to vote in the Democratic race, but has fallen further and further behind. The Michigan loss on Tuesday highlights his challenges moving forward: He surprisingly won the state in the 2016 Democratic primary race, bestingHillary Clintonand underlining what proved to be a surprisingly strong — if ultimately unsuccessful — challenge against her for the nomination. Clinton, 72, went on to win the Democratic primary, only to narrowly lose to Trump in the general election that fall. Her defeat, in part, hinged on an equally narrow loss to Trump in Michigan, which had been a reliable Democratic state before flipping to Trump. Many of the same voters who lifted Sanders to his upset win four years ago swung to Biden this week as Democratic turnout appeared to rise overall. “It’s time to focus on beating Donald Trump,” Biden said last week after his “Super Tuesday” victories in Texas, Virginia and elsewhere. Those wins dramatically reversed what had been a rough start for his campaign with distant finishes in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. “I’m here to report: We are very much alive,” Biden said on March 3. “And make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.” In a statement on Tuesday, Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale dismissed both candidates as “two sides of the same coin” and slammed their platforms as “socialist.” He also echoed criticisms from Trump, 73, and his allies about Biden’s age, while the Biden camp has routinely argued Trump is worried Biden would be his strongest challenger. “The Democrat candidate for president will be running on a big government socialist agenda regardless of the name on the ballot. It is also clear that the Democrat establishment has rallied around the confused Joe Biden in an effort to deny the nomination to Bernie Sanders,” Parscale said. “Either way, President Trump is on an unstoppable drive toward re-election.” Both Biden and Sanders had canceled their rallies planned for Tuesday in Cleveland amid concerns over the novel coronavirus outbreak and at health officials’ recommendation that Americans use “social distancing” and avoid large crowds. “In accordance with guidance from public officials and out of an abundance of caution, our rally in Cleveland, Ohio tonight is cancelled,” Biden’s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. In the coming days. Vice President Biden thanks all of his supporters who wanted to be with us in Cleveland this. Additional details on where Vice President Biden will address the press tonight are forthcoming. 2/2 — Kate Bedingfield (@KBeds)March 10, 2020 The former vice president’s campaign made a comeback last week on “Super Tuesday,” overtaking Sanders for the lead in the delegate count and securing a sweeping list of major endorsements in the process. Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, who had all dropped out of the primary race, all endorsed Biden before he went on to win 10 states on March 3. Still, Sanders won four states that night, including the largest, California, and remained within 100 delegates of Biden’s lead heading into Tuesday’s contests. RELATED:Who Is Still Running for President in 2020 RELATED:Melania Trump Cancels Fundraiser Appearance Because of ‘Scheduling Conflict’ Amid Coronavirus After “Super Tuesday” shook up the once crowded field of Democratic candidates, Biden also got an endorsement from billionaire Mike Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who spent historic amounts to raise his national profile through hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising. “Three months ago, I entered the race for president to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump — because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult,” Bloomberg, 78, said in a statement last Wednesday. “I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After [“Super Tuesday”]’s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.” Bloomberg — who Sandersaccusedof trying to “buy the presidency” during previous debates — said he was prepared to keep spending big to help whoever became the Democratic candidate.

On December 15, Skylar Mack, 18, of Loganville, Georgia, was sentenced to four months in prison for removing her geo-tracking bracelet and breaking her mandatory 14-day quarantine after two days in order to go watch her boyfriend, Vanjae Ramgeet, 24, a professional jet ski racer from the Cayman Islands, compete in an event. Mack was detained at the scene by police, who told theCayman Compassthat she was at the event for seven hours and did not wear a mask or practice social distancing. Ramgeet was also sentenced to four months in prison for aiding and abetting his girlfriend, and both pled guilty to their offenses. Now, Mack’s family is looking to the U.S. government for help getting the teen out of prison and back on American soil. RELATED:American Teen and Boyfriend Sentenced to 4 Months in Prison for Breaking Quarantine in Cayman Islands \"She knows she made a mistake. She owns up to that, but she's pretty hysterical right now,” Jeanne Mack, Skylar’s grandmother, toldTODAYin an on-screen interview on Monday, adding, \"She cries. She wants to come home.” According toTODAY, Jeanne has written a letter to President Trump asking for his assistance. A White House spokesman had no comment. A State Department spokesman tells PEOPLE they are “aware of reports of the detention of a U.S. citizen in the Cayman Islands” but declined to comment further, citing privacy. Speaking generally, however, the spokesman said the department \"takes seriously its responsibility to assist U.S. citizens abroad” and “when a U.S. citizen is detained overseas, the Department works to provide all appropriate consular assistance.” State Department assistance includes facilitating communication with the citizen’s family and others as well as monitoring the case for “a fair and transparent legal process” as well as “humane treatment,” the spokesman said.

She knows she should have to pay for it.\" However, Jeanne expressed that she believes that the Cayman Islands government is making an example of her granddaughter. \"We're not asking for her to get an exception. We're asking for her not to be the exception,” she said. Skylar, who had intended to return to the U.S. on December 22, and Ramgeet were both originally sentenced to a $2,600 fine and 40 hours of community service each, but the country’s Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), Patrick Moran, decided to appeal that sentence because he did not think it fit the crime. RELATED VIDEO: Couple Arrested After Boarding Flight to Hawaii Despite Testing Positive for COVID-19: Authorities “These offenses should have been met with far more stringent measures,” Moran said while appearing before the Grand Court on December 14. “When it comes to a matter of deterrence, the sentences imposed are likely to have little to no effect on other like-minded individuals.” “There is nothing exceptional about either defendant that should have warranted the sentence imposed by the lower court,” Moran said. Attorney Jonathan Hughes, who is representing both Mack and Ramgeet, told the court that he believes the current sentence is too harsh, and that both have already paid a significant price for their actions, according to theCompass. “There is no way that it can be right that a custodial sentence is imposed for a first-time offense on an 18-year-old defendant, who entered an early guilty plea,” said Hughes, noting that he believes his clients’ mistakes were due to “youthful ignorance and selfishness.” “Ms. Mack has paid her fine in full from her savings, which resulted in a significant portion of her funds being depleted,” he continued. “She has received hate mail, so far as to say even death threats. This has even impacted her father, who is also a professional jet-ski rider and has now lost sponsorship because of it.” Hughes will be arguing for a lesser sentence for his clients on Tuesday, before the country’s court of appeals. \"This particular sentence would have a particularly harsh effect on [Skylar], and the court ought to have considered the individual before it, not just the crime,\" Hughes toldTODAYon Monday. Ramgeet, for his part, was stripped of his victory at the jet ski event, and was made to return his prize money and trophy. He was also required to write a formal apology to the Cayman Islands Watercraft Association, and will not be allowed to compete in the first few races of 2021. According to theCompass, the country passed stricter Covid-19 suppression regulations on November 28 — the day after Skylar arrived in the country, and the day before she broke her quarantine.

Jodie Emerson said A Wisconsin state lawmaker is speaking out after her request to work virtually during theCOVID-19pandemic was reportedly denied despite her being immunocompromised. According to aMilwaukee Journal Sentinelarticle published Tuesday, state Rep. Jodie Emerson and her doctor had written a note to the state assembly speaker, Rep. Robin Vos, and the legislature's human resources director, Amanda Jorgenson, asking that Emerson be allowed to participate in sessions and committee hearings virtually from her office. Emerson was diagnosed years ago with an autoimmune disorder, according to the paper. Vos and Jorgenson denied Emerson's request on multiple occasions last month, according to letters obtained by theJournal Sentinel, falsely claiming thatCOVID-19can't be transmitted through the air and offering her a slate of plexiglass to stand behind, instead. \"COVID-19 is primarily transmitted from person-to-person through respiratory droplets,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionstates. \"These droplets are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks.\" The CDC has long recommended social distancing of six feet while in recent days federal health experts have warned that COVID-19 can be transmitted through the air at an even greater distance. \"It really feels like you're just not valued as a person — that my health doesn't matter,\" Emerson, a 48-year-old Democrat, told the paper. \"It is something that is so easy to do. I'd get it if what I was requesting was a half a million upgrade to the Capitol — that's not a reasonable accommodation.\" Emerson has now been fully vaccinated and is waiting for her doctor's clearance to relax her social distancing precautions, but she told theJournal-Sentinelshe's also worried about new variants of the respiratory disease. When asked by theJournal Sentinel, three epidemiologists disputed Vos and Jorgenson's claims about COVID-19 transmission. \"I don't know where they would get the boldness to say point-blank it's not airborne transmission,\" Amanda Simanek, an epidemiology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's School of Public Health, told the paper. RELATED:Ex-Lawmaker Settles Suit Related to His Bizarre Plot to Hide Workplace Affair After the newspaper reached out to Vos and Jorgenson, the two reportedly wrote Emerson another letter walking back their initial statements about COVID-19 not being airborne, although they still denied Emerson's request and instead offered her a box of face masks. Vos and Jorgenson did not respond to PEOPLE's request for comment. Emerson also did not immediately respond. Vos, a conservative Republican who has led the Wisconsin statehouse since 2013, has denied other lawmakers' requests to work virtually even before the pandemic.

Vos, however, didn't see it the same way. \"It just comes down to the fact that I think it's disrespectful for someone to be asking questions over a microphone or a speakerphone when individuals are actually taking the time out of their day to come and testify in person,\" the Republican said, according to theJournal Sentinel. The newspaper reports that Emerson's request could lead to a legal dispute and that she has retained an attorney, but hasn't filed a lawsuit.

Wade. The executive order, which Biden signed Wednesday during the inaugural meeting of the administration's recently established Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, is aimed at making it easier for patients to travel across state lines to receive abortion services. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to \"consider action to advance access to reproductive healthcare services,\" including allowing the use of Medicaid funds for patients who travel out-of-state for the procedure. If HHS enacts that plan, states could apply for Medicaid waivers when they provide abortions to people from out of state. It also calls on the HHS to ensure health care providers comply with federal non-discrimination laws when offering services. This comes after a bill, the Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act, to protect a patient's right to travel across state lines for abortion services, was blocked by the Republican-led Senate last month afterpassing the House of Representatives. Executive orders aresigned directives from the president, which don't require Congressional approval, that manage operations of the federal government. Though Congress can't pass laws to overturn an executive order, it can pass legislation that makes it difficult, or even impossible, to carry out the order, for example by removing funding. An executive order can be revoked by the president who issued it and a president has the ability to revoke executive orders issued by a predecessor. Biden has stated repeatedly that he doesn't have the authority as president to restore the right to abortion himself. \"The only way we can secure a woman's right to choose and the balance that existed is for Congress to restore the protections ofRoe v. Wadeas federal law,\" he previously explained. \"No executive action from the president can do that.\" Biden signed his first executive order related to abortion access in early July. The order vowed to \"ensure the safety of patients, providers, and third parties\" who have abortions or provide abortion services. Additionally, the order called on the HHS to submit a report detailing steps to take that can protect medication abortion, expand access to emergency contraceptives, and increase education about reproductive healthcare services. At the time, Biden urged the American people to assert their political power by voting for their abortion rights in the upcoming November elections, stressing that political change is needed in order restore the rights lost by the overturn ofRoe. \"I'm asking the Justice Department that, much like they did in the Civil Rights era, to do everything in their power to protect these women seeking to invoke their rights,\" Biden said.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

He recruited some of the best geologists, cartographers and zoologists in the world. He also brought along a photographer and a painter to document their findings and the 32 men headed west,\" Costner says. \"Their mission was two-fold: The search for mineral exploits that could benefit the American people and to find a path that could build a railroad that would connect the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean,\" he explains. \"They weren't here to protect Yellowstone, they were here to tear it to shreds in the name of progress.

We had a discussion and he asked me if he could do that.\" McCarthy added that he felt \"it was an appropriate decision that, until he can clear everything up, he's off of committees right now.\" The news that Santos was temporarily resigning from his assignments on the Small Business and Science Committees comes just days afterreports indicated that the Department of Justiceis investigating the lawmaker. Last week, theWashington Postreported that the DOJ asked the Federal Election Commission to hold off on taking any action against Santos — a signal that the DOJ itself may be investigating the Republican's campaign finances, which have raised numerous questions. Santos, who was sworn into office earlier this month, came under fire in December, whenThe New York Timesreported that a large portion of his biography could not be substantiated. The outlet alleged that he misled voters about his level of education, previous jobs and family ties to the Holocaust, news that earned bipartisan condemnation in recent days for misrepresenting himself. In an interview with theNew York Post, thecongressman admitted he lied aboutworking at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, as he had previously asserted, and revealed that he had also embellished his education, noting that he did not attend Baruch College or New York University.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Sean Spicermay have been the face of the Trump administration for its first month, but in the past two weeks, we’ve been seeing less of him and more of his deputy — Sarah Huckabee. If her name sounds familiar, there’s a reason: She’s the only daughter of former two-time Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. Sanders has worked on multiple campaigns in the past, including as the national political director for her father in 2008, and as his campaign manager in 2016. “He’s an amazing politician, but an even better parent,” Sanders toldTimeof her father. “Every day he challenges me to be a better person and I will forever be grateful for that.” After Huckabee’s campaign came to an end, she joined now-President Donald Trump‘s campaign as a senior adviser, eventuallygaining the deputy press secretary position in his White House. And as Spicer has been notably absent on-camera for the past two weeks, Sanders has played a larger and larger role representing the administration to the media. In particular, her rise in air time came just afterTrump tweeted that while he was president, Barack Obama’s administration wire tapped Trump’s phones during the presidential election. Trump offered no evidence for these claims,which he spoke of as facts, andthe FBI even asked the Justice Department to refute Trump’s allegations. A spokesperson for Obama alsodenied the allegations. (For the record, Obama seems unfazed.) But this weekend, it fell to Sanders to defend Trump’s tweets and a call for an investigation into the alleged wiretapping. During on-camera appearances as a White House spokesperson, Sanders handled this task of offering an explanation to Trump’s tweets — but it hasn’t gone well. On Sunday, she sat down for an interview with Martha Raddatz, ABC News’s Chief Global Affairs Correspondent. In the interview, Sanders says that Trump simply wants to findifthere was evidence of wire tapping by the Obama administration — which Raddatz then says is inaccurate, as Trump stated that Obama engaged in wire tapping as fact. Sanders spoke in the hypotheticals, saying thatifTrump’s claims are true (which, in his tweet, he refers to as facts) are true, that it is “the largest abuse of power that we’ve ever seen.” She also compared the “need” for investigation into the wire tapping to the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which has dominated headlines for weeks. Watch the full interview below. The difficulties continued on Monday, when Sanders sat down withGeorge Stephanopoulos onGood Morning America.She was rebuked by Stephanopoulos for making false or inaccurate claims several times during the interview. As Sanders takes to the news to defend Trump’s wire tapping claims, there’s an obvious question: What happened to Sean Spicer? Trump’s now-notorious press secretary shot to fame in the early weeks of his presidency, evenearning himself a parody onSaturday Night Live, courtesy of Melissa McCarthy. However,reports have surfaced in theNew York Timesthat Trump is none too pleased with Spicer — a claim that lent credence to Spicer’s sudden disappearance. Spicer, the former communications director of the Republican National Committee, is undeniably a Washington insider–the kind of personTrump said he didn’t want in his administrationthroughout his campaign of “drain the swamp” rhetoric. During the first weekend of Trump’s presidency, Spicer held a soon-to-be controversial first press briefing,in which he falsely claimed that Trump’s inauguration was the best-attended in history. RELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack Just last week,the hosts ofFox & Friendsasked Trump to give himself a grade on the job he’s done so far while in office. By his standards, he’s earned an A+ for effort, an A for achievement, but just a C or C+ in terms of messaging, saying bluntly that it “isn’t good.” That blame falls more on the shoulders of the administration’s chief messenger, Spicer, than on Trump himself. Trump also said that he would have “handled” the search for leakers in his department differently than Spicer did —Politicoreportedthat Spicer asked communications staffers to turn over their phones And according toThe New York Times, the negative coverage Trump has received is causing him “a lot of angst,” Christopher Ruddy, a longtime Trump pal says.

She suffers from chronic illnesses, including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, hadspinal surgery in 2016 which lead to financial difficultiesand a \"debilitatingdepression\" throughout 2017. And in 2018, two monumental life events happened: she lost her father, Herbert London, to heart disease and amyloidosis, andmet her girlfriend Cat Yezbak, a musician. Now, in a new interview with PEOPLE, the stylist, 50, is opening up about her journey since her days on TLC and how she's found a fresh perspective on life — and love. \"Dating was not at all in the cards for me,\" London tells PEOPLE about meeting Yezbak at a fundraiser for Cynthia Nixon’s gubernatorial race in the summer of 2018. \"My dad was so sick, and he was the top priority. It wasn’t that I didn’t think Cat was amazing, or cool, or cute, I just wasn’t in that mindset.\" London spent the majority of that year caring for her father, Herbert, an academic and founder and president of the London Center for Public Policy. He became \"very sick\" with heart disease and amyloidosis, an abnormal protein buildup in the tissues and organs, in April 2018 and died in November. \"I was in the hospital every other day,\" the stylist says. While London admits she'd \"butt heads all the time\" with her \"hard-core conservative\" Republican father, they were extremely close. \"We loved each other so deeply.\" During her time caring for Herbert, Yezbak, 40, kept in touch. \"Even when we weren't dating, she was so supportive, and knew my dad was sick, and even came to the funeral,\" says London. “I knew that I was lucking out by meeting somebody who was smart and compassionate and so kind.\" For more on Stacy London, pick up this week's issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday. One month after his death, the pair went on their first date and have been together ever since. While Yezbak never met Herbert, London wishes she could have. \"They would’ve liked each other,\" London says. \"They would’ve sparred over a lot of things. But, I really do think he brought her to me. He was watching out for me with her.\" London says Yezbak has brought \"a lot of love and happiness\" into her life, but she chooses her words wisely. \"I am very careful not to be too cavalier because, being 50 and being a privileged white woman, it's very easy for me to date a woman and there are no serious repercussions,\" London says. \"I work independently, so it's not like I could face discrimination at work. I am lucky that I have a family that loves me and accepts me for who I am. I stand on the shoulders of people who did not have that opportunity.\" RELATED:Stacy London Reveals Her 'First Serious Relationship with a Woman,' Introduces Girlfriend of a Year She continues: \"I'm careful to be say, 'things are so different' because they don't feel very different for me at all.

So I don't take that for granted.\" The stylist publiclyintroduced Yezbak in an Instagram postin December 2019 and have sharedsweet selfiestogether throughout the year. The pair are currently self-isolating in Brooklyn amid the coronavirus pandemic where they work on their vintage-collectibles business,Small Beautiful Things. \"I've been a collector my whole life.

Lazzarato, 24, tells PEOPLE she “was absolutely devastated that Trump decided to step back all the work that Obama did. We’d come so far. Trans kids were seeing love and support where they needed it. They needed to feel welcome in their schools and it really disappoints me that we’re back at square one in a lot of places after putting in so much work.” The YouTube star, who wasdetained at a Dubai airportin August for being transgender, recalls growing up feeling unsafe in public restrooms because of how she identified. RELATED VIDEO:Gigi Gorgeous Detained at Dubai Airport for Being Transgender “Growing up I always had to wonder if I was welcome and safe in the bathroom that I felt I should be using. Everyone should be able to go to the bathroom in a safe space,” says Lazzarato. “Trans kids are dealing with enough already and ultimately this is just creating a distraction that is going to keep them from concentrating on what they should be, which is their education.” “I hope all people — trans or not — stay strong and realize they have just as much self-worth as anyone else,” she continues. “It’s sad that this administration is making it seem like some people are lesser than others.” Despite Trump’s decision, the model says people need to confront the issues head on by participating in rallies, donating to organizations or letting their voice be heard through social media. “I’ve gone through struggle, not just as a transgender woman but as a human being,” says Lazzarato, whose transition and life story can be seen inthe new YouTube Red documentaryThis Is Everything: Gigi Gorgeous. “We all suffer and struggle and we need to learn to embrace what makes us the same and make life better for everyone.

The story goes that his nickname was coined by a reporter who overheard his father repeatedly calling his rambunctious toddler’s name: “John! John!” The moniker was adopted by the press corps and then by the public at large despite the fact that John Jr. himself “hated the nickname,” said Nancy McKeon, his mother’s personal assistant. Plenty of people called him John-John anyway, including strangers who watched him grow up before their eyes. They wept when his father was cut down by an assassin’s bullets’ in Dallas in 1963; teared up again when he lost his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, in 1994; and cheered when he married the love of his life, Carolyn Bessette, in a secret wedding in an old wooden church in Georgia two years later. The world mourned again when John Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn’s lives were cut short in a plane crash that also killed her sister, Lauren Bessette on July 16, 1999. “For a thousand days, he was a husband who adored the wife who became his perfect soulmate,” his uncle Ted Kennedy once said. “We dared to think… that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side.” In a new 96-page special edition, PEOPLE celebrates the life Kennedy led, from his early days in the White House to his years as a charismatic young adult, by capturing rarely seen photographs, printed here for the first time. To the end of his life, Kennedy remained an object of intense curiosity—and affection—to his fellow citizens. His public display of passion and love with Carolyn Bessette captured the nation’s attention—and heart—as well.

The Facebook COO, 50, announced on Friday that she and Bernthal, 46, were helping launch the COVID-19 Emergency Fund for Feeding Families in partnership with their local food bank,Second Harvest of Silicon Valley, to ensure families were being fed during the crisis. “The COVID-19 outbreak is hitting families hard and schools are already closing around the country,” shewrote in a Facebook post. “For the 22 million kids who rely on free and reduced-price meals nationwide, a school closure is more than an inconvenience: it’s an emergency.” “The issue of food security has never been more important in every neighborhood,” she continued. “In the Bay area alone, about 400,000 kids are fed by local schools, and they need our help.” Sandberg explained that Second Harvest was already getting grab-and-go meals at the closed schools and doing grocery runs for families in need, but their volunteer numbers had dropped drastically in recent days. “They normally have 80-100 volunteers on any given day,” she wrote. “But yesterday, only 17 were able to make it.” RELATED:Va.

But we do know there are families that need our help, right now. Every dollar counts.” “We hope you’ll join us in supporting Second Harvest Food Bank — or starting your own fundraiser for your local food bank,” she added. “Now, more than ever, we need to come together as a community to support those who need it most.” In addition to kicking off the fund, Sandberg and Bernthal said they’re teaming up with Nike CEO John Donahoe and his wife Eileen, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer, Additional Ventures co-founder Erin Hoffmann, Benchmark general partner Bill Gurley and his wife Amy, Intuit co-founder Scott Cook and his wife Signe Ostby, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman to make a joint donation of $5.5 million.

Cory Bookerwere among a group of witnesses whotestified on Capitol HillWednesday in support of a bill that would arrange a commission to help develop a proposal for slavery reparations. The two, alongside writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and others, spoke before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties on what happened to be Juneteenth, a celebratory holiday that marks the day enslaved African Americans in Texas belatedly learned in 1865 that the Civil War had ended and they were free — more than two years after the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. The three-hours-plus hearing centeredH.R. 40, a bill looking not to allocate money for reparations, but to build a 13-member commission to “study and consider a national apology and proposal for reparations for the institution of slavery.” Booker, a New Jersey Democrat who is currently running to be the party’scandidate in the 2020 election, called the hearing “important,” “historic,” and “urgent” in his testimony, arguing that African-Americans have been economically disadvantaged for generations because of policies that purposely exclude them and lead to racial wealth gaps and discrepancies in healthcare and the criminal justice system. “It is a cancer on the soul of our country,” Booker, 50, said. “This bill is the beginning of an important process … to find practical ideas to address the enduring injustices in our nation.” Coates, 43, delivered passionate testimony about the long-lasting effects of slavery and its legacy, which includes economic, social and political structural oppression. It was Coates’ 2014 article “The Case for Reparations” that not only rekindled the reparations debate, but cemented the topic as important and worthy of consideration. In the article, Coates noted that government-implemented policies (such as redlining, poll taxes and more) worked to further oppress and disadvantage Black Americans. The piece served as a catalyst for Wednesday’s hearing. “We recognize our lineage as a generational trust, as inheritance, and the real dilemma posed by reparations is just that: a dilemma of inheritance,” Coates said. “It is impossible to imagine America without the inheritance of slavery.” Glover, meanwhile, recalled his family history, explaining he was the great-grandson of a former slave who was freed by the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. \"Enslavement reigned for 250 years on these shores. When it ended, this country could've extended its hallowed principles — life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness — to all, regardless of color,\" writer Ta-Nehisi Coates told Congress. \"But America had other principles in mind\"pic.twitter.com/a1RYYhbSnq — PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour)June 19, 2019 TheLethal Weaponstar, who briefly worked in city administration before becoming an actor and has long advocated for various causes, also referenced his maternal grandparents, who spent their lives working as tenant farmers and sharecroppers in rural Georgia until they could afford a farm for themselves.

Trump made his latest remarks about his former political allyduring an interview SundayonFull Measure with Sharyl Attkissonafter he and his former attorney general had multiple back-and-forths on Twitter over the last couple of days. \"He's not mentally qualified to be attorney general,\" said Trump, 73. \"He was the biggest problem. I mean, look, Jeff Sessions put people in place that were a disaster.\" Sessions was one of the first major lawmakers in the U.S. to endorse Trump during his 2016 presidential bid and was given a position in his administration after the election, leaving behind a Senate seat in Alabama. But Sessions drew the ire of the president after recusing himself from the investigation into Trump's campaign connections with Russia during the 2016 election, which led to Robert Mueller's special counsel probe. Trump has long viewed Sessions' recusal from the investigation as a form of political and personal betrayal. \"The only reason I gave him the job is because I felt loyalty,” Trump has said about Sessions,according to theWashington Post. Sessions, 73, is currently running in a tight primary race for the Republican nomination for his old Senate seat in Alabama, which he resigned in order to serve in the Trump administration. The president endorsed Sessions' primary opponent, former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville, and has actively campaigned against Sessions in the election. Sessions and Tuberville will run against one another in a run-off election on July 14, with the primary winner then running against Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat, in the November general election. (Jones won the Alabama seat in a special election in 2017, narrowly defeating Roy Moore, a former judge whose candidacy had been swamped by controversy.) In recent days, Trump and Sessions have engaged in a highly unusual public back-and-forth — on Twitter, the president's favorite website. Trumptweetedlast week that Sessions had \"let our Country down\" and claimed he \"ran for the hills\" by recusing himself from the Russia investigation, while Sessions fired back by telling Trump his recusal was \"required by law.\" \"I did my duty & you're damn fortunate I did,\" Sessionstweetedin response to Trump last week. \"It protected the rule of law & resulted in your exoneration.\" RELATED:President Trump Goes Golfing at His Private Course in Virginia for First Time Since Coronavirus Outbreak The former attorney general has typically restrained himself from firing back at Trump. Over the weekend, however, Sessions tweeted at Trump five times after the president criticized him. \"I will never apologize for following the law and serving faithfully and with honor,\" Sessions tweeted at Trump, again referencing the Russia investigation. \"Neither of us knew about the phony investigation into our campaign until after I was sworn in.\" Trump suggested Sessions drop out of the run-off election against Tuberville, the former Auburn University football coach who Trump contends will make \"a GREAT Senator.\" Sessions hasn't hinted at dropping out of the race, however. Instead, the Republican candidate has promoted his relationship with Trump during the Alabama election — against the president's wishes. TheNew York Timesreported thatSessions sent out campaign mailers to Alabama voters earlier this year which referenced Trump 22 times. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign sent a letter to Sessions in early April demanding that he stop aligning himself with the president, saying that it was \"delusional\" for Sessions to present himself as an ally. “We only assume your campaign is doing this to confuse President Trump’s loyal supporters in Alabama into believing the president supports your candidacy in the upcoming primary runoff election,\" the Trump campaign wrote, according to theTimes. \"Nothing could be further from the truth.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Shuttered for the summer season, thesprawling property's white front gate was closed, and the employee entrance, usually left open, was blocked off by a security guard in a golf cart and a herd of parked vehicles that included black SUVs with tinted windows and police cars. Across the street, on the Southern Boulevard bridge that connects Palm Beach to West Palm Beach, about 60 Trump followers were gathered, waving American flags and holding signs and banners that read, \"Thank you Trump,\" \"Democrats are Fascists,\" \"Trump Won\" and other supportive messages in close proximity to reporters and TV crews. For more on Donald Trump, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day. The former president has been away all summer; he was last seen at Mar-a-Lago before Memorial Day Weekend. While the FBI conducted itssearch of the property, which reportedly focused on Trump's office and personal quarters, the former president was in New York inside Trump Tower. There on Fifth Avenue, the energy was reportedly less calm. \"Donald is furious yet scared,\" a source close to Trump tells PEOPLE. \"He feels victimized and is calling everyone he trusts to give him advice and reassure him that this is a witch hunt. He is buoyed by the Republican support [after the] invasion of privacy.\" The FBI searched the property as part of an ongoing investigation into an allegedmishandling of White House records, including potentially classified materials,Politico,CNN,The Washington Postand other news outlets reported. It's one of two known investigations underway by the Justice Department, which is also looking at the former president's role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and alleged efforts by Trump and his supporters to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election that Biden won. Monday's development, which the source said frightened Trump, could affect his political calculations as he weighs a third run for the presidency in 2024. Trump has repeatedly hinted at plans to launch a campaign and has even saidall that's left to decide is when to announce. But the source suggests that could all be an act, telling PEOPLE that though Trump will act like he's running, talk like he's running and raise money like he's running, he may not actually vie for the seat. \"He has a good life now and is enjoying it,\" the source says. \"He is definitely making the moves to run but, in the end, I don't think he will unless he is convinced criminal charges are coming,\" adds the source. As an active candidate for the presidency, Trump could further push the argument that the criminal investigations he's facing are politically motivated. As a sitting president, he could be even more protected from prosecution given the Justice Department's long-standing practice of never charging a sitting president with a crime. He would also again be able to appoint and remove officials from the DOJ and FBI.

Boebert, 35, ran in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District against Democrat Adam Frisch, a former city council member and finance professional from Aspen. For a time while votes were being counted, it appeared likely she may be unseated after only one term in office. The politician — a provocative right-winger in the mold of former PresidentDonald Trump— had beenheavily favoredto win reelection going into Nov. 8, but when results began pouring in, Frisch was unexpectedly in the lead. She eventually surpassed Frisch, and finished within 0.5 points of him, triggering an automatic recount that will delay the official call. With more than 95 percent of ballots counted as of Thursday evening,The New York Timesdeclared thatBoebert garnered50.08 percent of the votes while Frisch had 49.92. Prior to the first votes being posted on election night that suggested a tough battle for Boebert,she tweeted triumphantly, \"The red wave has begun! . . . America First is winning!\" First elected to Congress in 2020, Boebert won the Republican primary in her western Colorado district in June. The lawmaker's freshman term has beencheckered with controversythat Boebert herself courted. Earlier this year, she called a Republican primary challenger a \"groomer,\" a term for a person who sexually abuses children. Shefeuded last yearwith Minnesota Rep.Ilhan Omar, about whom she has made racist comments, calling her a member of \"the jihad squad\" and accusing her of \"praising terrorists.\" Boebert was alsoaccused of meeting with organizersof pro-Trump rallies on Jan. 6, 2021. She has denied any involvement in theviolent riotthat followed, though hertweets during the attack— \"Today is 1776,\"one said, while another indicated House SpeakerNancy Pelosi's whereabouts — have been criticized. A fervent gun advocate who vowed in a political ad tocarry a weaponto work in Congress, Boebert reportedly got into a standoff with Capitol Police when sherefused to allow officers to search her bagafter setting off metal detectors just days after the insurrection. The editorial board of Boebert's state newspaper of record,The Denver Post, offered a blisteringly critical assessment of her tenure, imploring voters in a recent op-ed not to vote for the incumbent congresswoman this year.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The Killingly Board of Education removed the Redmen mascot in July amid complaints that it was racist A Connecticut high school is drawing flak after it reinstated its longtime mascot just six months after it was removed amid claims the “Redmen” name and logo was offensive to Native Americans. Killingly High School has been represented by the Redmen since 1939 – but in July, the school board voted to nix the name, and three months later, replaced it with a new mascot, the Red Hawks,The New York Timesreported. The change was short-lived, however, as new members took control of the school board in November and on Wednesday reinstated the Redmen mascot in a 5-4 vote during a board meeting, according to theHartford Courant. The Red Hawks mascot was previously removed during a meeting in December. The board also reportedly said it hopes to update the school’s logo so as not to be offensive to Native Americans, and that there were discussions about teaching students about Native American heritage. Last week’s five-hour meeting was reportedly a heated one, and drew arguments both from those who claimed the Redmen name was offensive and racist, and from those who said the word was actually a way to honor Native Americans,NBC affiliate WVITreported. “I recognize there have been many Native Americans who have voiced those concerns. But I would say there is an equal amount of Native people who feel the opposite,” Republican board member Jason Muscara, who supported the Redmen name, said, according to theTimes. According to theCourant, Muscara also argued that students who supported reinstating the mascot had reached out to him to say they felt as though they couldn’t publicly voice their opinions. “If we’re going to talk about respecting our students and protecting our students and doing what’s best for our students, we need to respect the opinion of all of our students, not just the ones we agree with,” he said, while other Republican board members argued that it had “nothing to do with race.” Still, the mascot — whose logo features the profile of a Native American man wearing a traditional headdress — has faced opposition previously from local tribes including the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and the Nipmuc Tribal Nation, who considered it racist, theCourantreported.

But the people who are directly impacted have spoken and we chose to not listen to them.” The Redmen mascot has also faced opposition from teachers and students, like school athletic director Kevin Marcoux, who reportedly spoke at the meeting and said his team had become the “laughingstock” of Connecticut.

And all because people don’t want to let go of tradition. This has made Killingly a laughingstock.” Following the decision to reinstate the mascot, the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation released a statement to theCourantthat encouraged board members to take another look at their decision. “Although we appreciate the Board of Education’s decision to establish a subcommittee to develop a Native American centered curriculum, we’re disappointed in their vote to reinstate the offensive Redmen mascot,” the statement said. “We support the sentiments shared by members of our Youth Council at yesterday’s hearing, and believe the mascot doesn’t honor or represent Native people and has no place in our school system.” A spokesperson for the Killingly Board of Education did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Stephanie Mohr, a canine handler for the Prince George’s County Police Department in Maryland, received a full pardon on Wednesday from Trump, 25 years after her crime. “She served 10 years in prison for releasing her K-9 partner on a burglary suspect in 1995, resulting in a bite wound requiring ten stitches,” the White House said in astatement. “Officer Mohr was a highly commended member of the police force prior to her prosecution. Today’s action recognizes that service and the lengthy term that Ms. Mohr served in prison.” Mohr was convicted by a federal jury in 2001 of violating the man’s civil rights, as she set her dog on him after he surrendered, according to theAssociated Pressand theWashington Post. The conviction came as the Prince George’s County Police Department faced an investigation by the Justice Department, as well as multiple lawsuits alleging police brutality, thePostreported. According tocourt records, Mohr — who was new to the department — was among several police officers who responded to a possible burglary in Takoma Park, an area that had recently seen a rash of commercial burglaries. Two men, including Ricardo Mendez, were found on the roof of a building, though it was later found that they were homeless and just sleeping there. RELATED:Who Donald Trump Has Pardoned So Far Police present at the time later testified that officers ordered the suspects down from the roof, and Mendez complied, keeping his hands in the air the entire time as per officer demands. Testimony stated that after Mendez climbed down, another K-9 officer present asked if Mohr’s dog could “get a bite” — and after the officer and Mohr had a brief exchange, she released the dog, which attacked Mendez in the leg, despite the fact that he remained still and was not making any attempts to leave the scene. RELATED VIDEO: Trump Legal Adviser Previously Called Him an ‘Idiot’ and a 'Bully’ but Now Says ‘I Was Completely Wrong’ Mohr’s version of events, however, was that she gave a K-9 warning while the suspects were still on the roof, and that Mendez did not follow orders and did not raise his hands despite being asked to multiple times. She also testified that he was trying to flee when she released the dog. \"My thought process was … you don't know what they're going to do when they come down. They could surrender, they could run – which they did, one tried to – or they could just fight,\" Mohr said, perUSA Today. \"My thought process was I have to be prepared … We had no idea about their status. We hadn't approached them, hadn't touched them, hadn't searched them.\" RELATED:Trump Pardons Jared Kushner’s Dad, Who Paid a Prostitute to Seduce His Brother-in-Law The now-50-year-old Mohr toldUSA Todaythat she was “so grateful” for this week’s pardon. “So many emotions flooding through me. It’s been a long, long, long battle for this,” she said. “There are issues with police brutality in our country. I was not a police officer who participated in that.” She was one of 26 people to receive full pardons from Trump, while another three people had part or all of their sentences commuted.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Chasten Buttigiegis the first to admit that his new book,I Have Something to Tell You—For Young Adults, is coming out at an opportune, but unplanned, time. A new version of his bestselling 2020 memoir, it debuts as books geared toward LGBTQ+ youth are beingbannedin schools around America. Those bans weren't in the headlines when Buttigieg first sat down to re-write his memoir, which he describes as \"the book I wish I could go back in time and hand to younger Chasten.\" But after the original publication date was delayed due to the birth of his now1-year-old twinswith husbandPete Buttigieg— current secretary of transportation who ran for president in 2020 — the memoir now debuts as thousands of books have been banned in recent months by conservative school districts around the country. According to arecent studyfrom PEN America, many of those books were written by LGBTQ+ authors and writers of color. \"Many people are quicker to play politics than they are to find solutions,\" Buttigieg acknowledges to PEOPLE. \"I know that my life is under a microscope. I know that people play politics with my family.\" He continues: \"And I know that some people will be more bothered by the existence of a story than by the fact that young people in this country are wondering whether or not they belong, especially young people who have seen their friends hauled out of schools in body bags.\" Buttigieg says he tries to remember that some of the discussion surrounding LGBTQ+ issues on social platforms like Twitter isn't illustrative of what average Americans are actually thinking. \"Whatever's happening on social media, people tend to believe that's the public square,\" Buttigieg says. The former middle school teacher, who took a leave of absence to support his husband's 2020 presidential campaign, offers up a schoolhouse analogy: \"All of those people think they're the only ones in the cafeteria, but they're actually just one table in the cafeteria. If you zoom out, you realize most people don't care about whatever they're talking about at that table.\" While he's no longer spending time in the cafeteria, Buttigieg had his own former students in mind when writing the new version of his book. In it, he expands on many of his own stories he thought could resonate with younger people — like those about \"growing up in an environment where I did not know it was okay to be gay.\" \"I thought something was wrong with me [when I was young],\" Buttigieg says. \"I felt like people's opinions about me defined me. I didn't realize that one day I'd grow up and be on a presidential campaign and feel so empowered by leaning into what others said would define me.\" After the release of his first book, which debuted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Buttigieg was elated to be receive feedback from those who, like him, had long felt different. \"It's still so weird to have a college student come up to you and say, 'It's almost like we lived the same life,'\" he says. \"To know that — just by existing and just by putting out there, 'Here's what happened to me' — it can make other people feel seen and supported and less alone ... that means so much to me.\" Of course, an additional audience for the book will be parents and teachers, which is why Buttigieg included a section on \"conversation starters for families and teachers\" — topics that he hopes will spur a larger discussion and that he plans to delve into during an 18-stop book tour (which includes many of the states where book bans have taken effect). \"I understand what it's like to be a teacher watching students struggle with not seeing themselves reflected in the books that they're reading,\" Buttigieg says. Buttigieg also has a new understanding of what it means to parent young children, acknowledging that his thoughts on the book shifted with the birth of his kids, Joseph \"Gus\" August and Penelope Rose. \"One day, I will no longer be here and this book will exist and they'll be able to say, 'My dad wrote this book about his childhood.' And that gets me really emotional,\" he says. \"What am I leaving behind as a legacy? What kind of world am I building for my kids?\" The kids are the focus for Buttigieg, who describes the \"tightrope walk\" of navigating life as a public figure and raising young children. One challenge lies in the busy schedules he and his husband juggle. On his book tour, Buttigieg will visit a different city every day for two weeks. Meanwhile, his husband travels frequently for his role in Biden's Cabinet. But the couple makes an effort to connect often, even if that means a phone call on the way to or from daycare, or FaceTimes after the kids are asleep. And when the two are together, there are the occasional date nights, though they look a lot different than when the couple first started dating in 2015, after meeting on the dating app Hinge. \"The older the kids get, the more date night has turned into takeout and Netflix,\" Buttigieg admits. \"Once you get them down and put up all the bath toys, you don't really want to put a suit on and go to an event. But Pete is really good about putting his phone down and flipping that switch.\" The transportation secretary is also skilled at providing feedback, Buttigieg says, such as when he would show his husband passages of the book to look over before it was published. \"He can either be strategic or he can be bolstering. He asks, 'What kind of feedback would you like?' And he's so good about sending encouraging messages,\" Buttigieg says of Pete.

The partnership is one that's grown amid monumental life changes for the couple, who now juggle being under the political microscope and raising small children — one of whom, Penelope, recently discovered how to get out of her own crib — \"not the best thing at 3:00 in the morning,\" Buttigieg laughs. But it's his new life as a dad, Buttigieg acknowledges, that makes the message of his new book all the more poignant. \"We're training our replacements, as Pete always says. I know that this book can do some good. And I hope that it makes them proud.\" I Have Something to Tell You—For Young Adults: A Memoirwill be published Tuesday, May 16.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: (San Francisco)— A federal appeals court refused Thursday to reinstate President Donald Trump’s ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations, dealing another legal setback to the new administration’s immigration policy. In a unanimous decision, the panel of three judges from the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to block a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travelers to enter the U.S. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is possible. The court rejected the administration’s claim that it did not have the authority to review the president’s executive order. President Trump responded angrily on Twitter shortly after the deicision was announced. SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)February 9, 2017 “There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy,” the court said. The judges noted that the states had raised serious allegations about religious discrimination. U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban last week after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The ban temporarily suspended the nation’s refugee program and immigration from countries that have raised terrorism concerns. Justice Department lawyers appealed to the 9th Circuit, arguing that the president has the constitutional power to restrict entry to the United States and that the courts cannot second-guess his determination that such a step was needed to prevent terrorism. The states said Trump’s travel ban harmed individuals, businesses and universities. Citing Trump’s campaign promise to stop Muslims from entering the U.S., they said the ban unconstitutionally blocked entry to people based on religion. Both sides faced tough questioning during an hour of arguments Tuesday conducted by phone — an unusual step — and broadcast live on cable networks, newspaper websites and social media. It attracted a huge audience. The judges hammered away at the administration’s claim that the ban was motivated by terrorism fears, but they also challenged the states’ argument that it targeted Muslims. “I have trouble understanding why we’re supposed to infer religious animus when, in fact, the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected,” Judge Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush nominee, asked an attorney representing Washington state and Minnesota. Only 15 percent of the world’s Muslims are affected by the executive order, the judge said, citing his own calculations. “Has the government pointed to any evidence connecting these countries to terrorism?” Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked the Justice Department attorney. The lower-court judge temporarily halted the ban after determining that the states were likely to win the case and had shown that the ban would restrict travel by their residents, damage their public universities and reduce their tax base. Robart put the executive order on hold while the lawsuit works its way through the courts. After that ruling, the State Department quickly said people from the seven countries — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — with valid visas could travel to the U.S. The decision led to tearful reunions at airports round the country.

Renegades: Born in the USA, the second Spotify series from the Obamas' productiom company, will feature the former president, 59, and Springsteen, 71, \"in deep and revealing conversation with each other, exploring a wide array of topics including race, fatherhood, marriage, and the state of America,\" according to a news release. In an exclusive clip shared with PEOPLE, Obama and Springsteen have a frank discussion about racism, its poisonous roots in American history and its effects today. \"How do you hold the same country that sent man to the moon with being the same country of Jim Crow?\" Springsteen asks Obama. \"You don't make peace with that obviously, but how you sort of hold that being the same America?\" The former president replies: \"I think that it is, partly, because we never went through a true reckoning — and so we just buried one huge part of our experience and our citizenry in our minds.\" RELATED:Barack Obama Joining Michelle Obama for 'Intimate Conversation' in First Episode of Her Podcast Renegadesfollows former First LadyMichelle Obama'sself-titled podcast, launched last July.

The first episode, \"Outsiders: An Unlikely Friendship,\" recounts how the former president and \"Born in the USA\" singer became friends during the 2008 presidential campaign, while the second centers around race in the United States. \"It is a personal, in-depth discussion between two friends exploring their pasts, their beliefs, and the country that they love—as it was, as it is, and as it ought to be going forward,\" the release from Spotify states. After becoming friends more than a decade ago, Springsteen played a farewell concert for Obama upon his exit from the White House in 2017, about two months after Obama awarded the 20-time Grammy Award winner with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \"I am the president, he is the boss,\" Obama said during the ceremony, paying homage to Springsteen's nickname before giving him the award.

President Trump’s pick for Secretary of Labor,CKE Restaurants CEO Andy Puzder, withdrew his nomination, a senior Administration official told TIME. In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, Puzder did not give a reason for his withdrawal. “I am honored to have been considered by President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Labor and put America’s workers and businesses back on a path to sustainable prosperity,” he said in a statement. “I want [to] thank President Trump for his nomination. I also thank my family and my many supporters– employees, businesses, friends, and people who have voiced their praise and hopeful optimism for the policies and new thinking I would have brought to America as Secretary of Labor. While I won’t be serving in the administration, I fully support the President and his highly qualified team.” The withdrawal comes aftera week of scrutinyof decades-old abuse allegations fromPuzder’s ex-wife, which she has since retracted. Lisa Henning, who now goes by Lisa Fierstein, alleged in 1988 divorce filings that Puzder physically assaulted her in 1986, resulting in “severe and permanent” injuries including “bruises and contusions to the chest, back, shoulders and neck” and two ruptured discs that caused her to seek medical attention, according to records of the divorce obtained by TIME. Henning also appeared in disguise to discuss her experience in a 1990Oprahepisode about domestic violence. Henning said her ex-husband (whom she does not name in the tape) “vowed revenge” when she made the abuse allegations public, according toa copy of the tape obtained by POLITICO. “Remember my ex-husband was a public figure. Everyone knew him and knew what he was doing,” Henning said in the Oprah interview. “And once I made that public, he vowed revenge, he said ‘I’ll see you in the gutter, this will never be over, you will pay for this.'” Puzder also came under scrutiny last week foremploying an undocumented immigrantto clean his home. He said in a statement that he had not known the housekeeper was undocumented, and that once he found out, he and his wife immediately fired her and offered her help to get legal status. Puzder has beenwidely criticizedby unions and worker’s rights organizations. Workers at Carl’s Jr. and Hardees, which are operated by Puzder-run CKE restaurants, filed 33 state and federal complaints against their employer for wage theft, sexual harassment, unfair overtime practices, among other things. The nomination process was also derailed by Puzder’sattempts to disentangle his financial assetsfrom anything that might constitute a conflict of interest. In order to serve, Puzder would have to step down as CEO of CKE Restaurants and divest from more than 200 companies and funds. Puzder delayed filing the necessary financial paperwork for weeks. He has also voiced support for replacing workers with robots: “They’re always polite, they always upsell, they never take a vacation, they never show up late, there’s never a slip-and-fall, or an age, sex, or race discrimination case,”he told Business Insiderin 2016. Puzder also had a long record ofsupporting immigration reform, which puts him at-odds with an administration that’s advocating for a tougher approach.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Al Frankentook to Facebook on Thanksgiving morningto reflect on the “broader conversation” about the experiences of women in the United States. Franken begins the lengthy post about his love for the holiday, mentioning his wife of 43 years,Franni, and their two children, but also recalls how last Thanksgiving was tough on him and his family. “I’ve also spent a lot of time over this past year thinking about the broader conversation we’ve been having about the experience of women in this country. I know that, for so many people, this issue raises a lot of powerful and painful feelings,” he wrote. “This conversation can also be incredibly complicated. I don’t think it’s my place to weigh in on all the debates – but I will continue to listen and learn.” The former Democratic junior senator, who announced his resignation on Dec. 7, 2017, wrote that “after a year of reflection, I’m finding it a lot easier to be grateful this Thanksgiving. Grateful for having had the chance to help make a difference on issues I care about. Grateful to all my supporters in Minnesota and across the country who made that journey not just possible, but joyful. Grateful to everyone who has reached out to wish me well – and, more importantly, kept carrying forward the fights I was proud to lead as a Senator.” Franken was accused ofinappropriately touchingseven women, including Leeann Tweeden, a morning news anchor on KABC radio in Los Angeles, who alleged thatFranken groped and forcibly kissed herduring a USO tour in 2006, before he became a senator. The Senate Ethics Committee launched an investigation into the senator as more women began to come forward with allegations. Franken repeatedly apologized for his inappropriate behavior, which he said was unintentional but “crossed a line” for some women. “Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently,” he said during his resignation. “It’s become clear that I can’t both pursue the Ethics Committee process and at the same time remain an effective senator for them. Let me be clear: I may be resigning my seat but I am not giving up my voice.” While Franken stated that “representing Minnesota in the Senate was the greatest job I’ll ever have” and that he still misses “being in the fight every day,” he “certainly” won’t be running for office again soon. “I hope that, in the next year, I’ll have the chance to help make a difference again,” he added.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

In court documents filed in Los Angeles and publicly shared by her lawyer Michael Avenatti on Twitter, Daniels, who was born Stephanie Clifford, states the pair had multiple sexual encounters, including at a July 2006 golf tournament in Lake Tahoe and “well into the year 2007.” RELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Writer Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack Clifford accused Trump of not signing the NDA thus “rendering it legally null and void and of no consequence.” Clifford statedTrump used the pseudonym “David Dennison”or “DD” in the agreement, according to the lawsuit documents. The suit also claimedTrump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, signed the agreement on behalf of his client11 days before the presidential election and around the time of the now-infamousAccess Hollywoodtapein October 2016. “As a result of Ms. Clifford’s efforts aimed at publicly disclosing her story and her communications with various media outlets, Ms. Clifford’s plans came to the attention of Mr. Trump and his campaign, including Mr. Michael Cohen,” the lawsuit alleged.

During a heated argument over the phone with Joe, the mother of four revealed that he had required her to sign a prenuptial agreement before the two walked down the aisle back in 1999 — something she was reluctant to do at the time. “You made me sign a prenup, okay!” Teresa, 47, told Joe, 49. “A week before we were getting married, Joe asked me to sign a prenup and I just felt when you love someone, you don’t do that,” Teresa then explained in a confessional. Though she said she “wasn’t going to go through with it,” Teresa stressed that she couldn’t imagine actually cancelling their nuptials. “Being Italian, I have old school parents, and it’s an embarrassing thing to call off a wedding,” Teresa said. Instead, she agreed to sign it on one condition: that a clause be added voiding the prenup if there was ever infidelity. “I didn’t even read it, I just said, ‘I want you to put one thing in there. If you ever cheat, the prenup is void,'” Teresa said.

Just in December, a source close to the family exclusively told PEOPLE the two had come to the decision to separate, but were not yet making any plans for divorce. “They agreed that each had to move on,” the insider said. “They are doing so amicably and very slowly. Joe has been out on a few dates, Teresa has not. She has been too busy with the girls, with work obligations and taking care of her father. She is happy for Joe. They have been very friendly with one another and are very supportive of each other’s happiness. They still love one another, but … neither is interested in a long distance relationship.” The Giudices have been living apart since March 2016, when Joe began his 41-month prison sentence for mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud (Teresa had served a little over 11 months in prison for the same crimes, and wasreleased on Dec. 23, 2015). Though Joe wasreleased in March 2019, he chose to move into the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Clinton County Correctional Center in Pennsylvania as he fought to appeal a judge’s deportation order.

You and this stupid prenup that you keep bringing up? I didn’t want to get married, all right?” he told Teresa. At the time Joe said that, the two were in the midst of an argument, triggered by jokes Joe made about Teresa’s spending. “You got nothing to do, all you do is go shopping and you spend money,” Joe said on the phone, telling their daughter Gia, “Your mother is like Robin Hood. She takes from her husband and spends it all on the stores. … The money that you spend on nails and hair, you’d be able to retire on!” That line annoyed Teresa, who had famously worked to pull her family out of debt after their financial decisions sent them each to prison. “I’m not taking from my husband, though,” Teresa said. “You haven’t been here in three years.

Boylan expanded on her story in alengthy post published on Mediumon Wednesday. \"There is a part of me that will never forgive myself for being a victim for so long, for trying to ignore behavior that I knew was wrong. The Governor exploited my weaknesses, my desire to do good work and to be respected,\" she wrote. \"I was made to believe this was the world I needed to survive in.\" Cuomo and his aides have vigorously denied Boylan's account. \"As we said before, Ms. Boylan's claims of inappropriate behavior are quite simply false,\" spokeswoman Catilin Girouard said in statement on Wednesday. Cuomo told reporters in December: \"I fought for and I believe a woman has the right to come forward and express her opinion and express issues and concerns that she has. But it's just not true.\" In her post this week, Boylan — who worked for the Cuomo administration from 2015 to 2018, most recently as deputy secretary of economic development and a special adviser to Cuomo — alleged that he \"created a culture within his administration where sexual harassment and bullying is so pervasive that it is not only condoned but expected.\" \"Telling my truth isn't about seeking revenge. I was proud to work in the Cuomo Administration. For so long I had looked up to the Governor,\" Boylan wrote. 'But his abusive behavior needs to stop.\" She first alleged misconduct by Cuomo in a series of tweets in December, writing that he \"sexually harassed [her] for years.\" \"Many saw it, and watched. I could never anticipate what to expect: would I be grilled on my work (which was very good) or harassed about my looks. Or would it be both in the same conversation? This was the way for years,\" Boylanwrote. \"Not knowing what to expect what's [sic] the most upsetting part aside from knowing that no one would do a damn thing even when they saw it. No one. And I *know* I am not the only woman,\" she tweeted. At the time, Boylan did not go into detail about the alleged harassment andtweetedthat she had \"no interest in talking to journalists\" about the matter. In her post on Wednesday, she wrote of the media interest after her initial tweets last year. \"As messages from journalists buzzed on my phone, I laid in bed unable to move. I finally had decided to speak up, but at what cost?\" she wrote. Boylan began working in New York government in 2015, as executive vice president of the state's economic development arm and was later the chief of staff there. Among her claims about Cuomo's behavior in her post on Wednesday, Boylan wrote that he made a \"crude comment\" about playing strip poker during an October 2017 flight aboard his government plane. \"He was seated facing me, so close our knees almost touched. His press aide was to my right and a state trooper behind us,\" she wrote in the post. \"'That's exactly what I was thinking,' I responded sarcastically and awkwardly. I tried to play it cool,\" she wrote.\" But in that moment, I realized just how acquiescent I had become.\" RELATED:Gov. Cuomo Admits 'Mistake' in Releasing Information on Nursing Home COVID Deaths In a statement provided to PEOPLE by Cuomo's office, four people who say they were on the flight in question — John Maggiore, Howard Zemsky, Dani Lever and Abbey Fashouer Collins — denied such a conversation occurred. \"We were on each of these October flights and this conversation did not happen,\" their statement read. The governor's office also provided manifests of all of Cuomo's October 2017 flights, saying there was \"no flight where Lindsey was alone with the Governor, a single press aide, and a NYS Trooper.\" Boylan, who launched a run for Manhattan borough president in November, wrote in her Medium post this week that she decided to come forward with her allegations in December after another former staffer told her \"that she, too, had been the subject of the Governor's workplace harassment.\" \"Her story mirrored my own. Seeing his name floated as a potential candidate for U.S. Attorney General — the highest law enforcement official in the land — set me off,\" Boylan wrote. In her Medium post, Boylan objected to what she describes as Cuomo's uncomfortable interest in her; his crude behavior around women (disparaging colleagues about their weight or ridiculing their romantic partners); and his physical harassment — how he \"would go out of his way to touch me on my lower back, arms and legs\" and kissed her on her lips as she was leaving a meeting. RELATED:New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo Accused of Sexual Harassment by Former Aide She wrote that it traced back to when her boss \"informed me that the Governor had a 'crush' on me\" shortly after she first met Cuomo, in January 2016. Boylan included in her post screenshots of emails and messages along with some of her remembrances, including one that she wrote was from Stephanie Benton, then the director of the governor's offices, dated Dec. 14, 2016. After asking Benton to \"please relay my thanks to the Governor\" for letting her join an off-site work event, Boylan said she received an unusual reply in which Benton wrote that \"he Governor suggested I look up images of Lisa Shields — his rumored former girlfriend — because 'we could be sisters' and I was 'the better looking sister.' \" After that, wrote Boylan, \"the Governor began calling me 'Lisa' in front of colleagues. It was degrading.\" RELATED:Andrew Cuomo Recalls Fearing for His 3 Daughters During Family COVID-19 Scare Boylan also includes a text conversation between she and her mother dated November 2016, in which she wrote that she didn't trust Cuomo, adding that he was \"being creepy\" and \"has a crush\" on her. She also detailed an instance in which she claims she was invited to the state capitol following a work holiday party by the \"Governor's body person,\" who called her from an unlisted number to \"[tell] me to come to the Capitol because the Governor wanted to see me.\" Before she entered the building, Boylan wrote, she called her husband: \"I told him I was afraid of what might happen. That was unlike me. I was never afraid.\" Upon entering the governor's office, Boylan said Cuomo allegedly showed her around as she tried to \"maintain [her] distance.\" \"He paused at one point and smirked as he showed off a cigar box. He told me that President Clinton had given it to him while he served as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,\" Boylan wrote. \"The two-decade old reference to President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was not lost on me.\" Boylan wrote that Cuomo did not touch her during the incident because he \"must have sensed my fear because he finally let me out of the office.\" RELATED VIDEO: FKA Twigs Sues Ex-Boyfriend Shia LaBeouf for 'Relentless' Sexual, Physical and Emotional Abuse RELATED:Andrew Cuomo & Daughters Look Back at 3 Months in Center of COVID-19 Pandemic — A 'Silver Lining' in Heartache In her post, Boylan wrote that she expected to be targeted by Cuomo over her story. In December, she wrote, \"Parts of a supposed confidential personnel file (which I've never seen) were leaked to the media in an effort to smear me.\" After Boylan's initial accusation,the Associated Press reportedit had obtained \"personnel memos written in 2018\" that \"indicate that Boylan resigned after she was confronted about complaints about her own office behavior.\" According to the AP's reporting, the administration's ethics officer, Julia Pinover Kupiec, wrote that several women issued complaints to the Empire State Development's human resources department stating that \"Ms. Boyland [sic] had behaved in a way towards them that was harassing, belittling, and had yelled and been generally unprofessional.\" In a meeting with government officials, including governor's top lawyer, Boylan was \"counseled\" about the issues, the AP reported, and she resigned soon afterward. Boylan wrote Wednesday: \"I'm compelled to tell my story because no woman should feel forced to hide their experiences of workplace intimidation, harassment and humiliation — not by the Governor or anyone else.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Vito Perillo, a 93-year-old World War II veteran, pulled off a big upset win this week, ousting the incumbent mayor of a town on the Jersey Shore. Perillo, who served in the U.S. Navy in the South Pacific, was inspired to run because of Tinton Falls’ high property taxes — an issue vexing just about every property owner in New Jersey. So Perillo tells PEOPLE he wore out 1 ½ pairs of shoes walking to every home in the borough as he campaigned on promises of transparency and lower municipal taxes. A first-time campaigner who never ran for any office before, Perillo knew he was a longshot against Mayor Gerald Turning, 63, Tinton Falls’ former police chief and borough administrator. But no matter. “If anyone’s 93-year-old grandfather came to them and said, ‘I want to run for mayor,’ they would think he was a bit crazy,” says Perillo’s grandson, Michael Perillo-Gentile, 28. “But they don’t know my grandfather.” When the results came in Tuesday night that Perillo had defeated Turning, “I was elated, I felt good,” Perillo tells PEOPLE. “More importantly I was happy for my family, I could see the smiles on their faces,” he continues. “The fact that I worked so hard made it that much nicer.” Perillo, a retired electronics engineer for the department of defense, will be 97 at the end of his term. He heard just one disparaging comment about his age. “From the present mayor,” Perillo says, “who said at 93 it was kinda late to get into politics or something to that effect, that I wasn’t up to doing the job — but I knew better. I say nonsense.” PEOPLE emailed Turning for comment, but has not yet received a reply. RELATED VIDEO: Jenna and Barbara Bush Needed ‘Comfort’ After Trump’s Election and Miss the ‘Softer Side’ of Politics Perillo tells PEOPLE that one of the reasons he entered the race was due to information his daughter showed him about a pair of whistleblower lawsuits involving the police department that cost Tinton Falls over $1 million in settlements. “Very wasteful (in spending taxpayer dollars) and there is no transparency,” he says. “I want the people to know what’s going on.” Perillo lost his wife of 64 years, Mamie, three years ago. A father of two daughters, as well as a grandfather and great-grandfather, he remains spry thanks to workouts at the YMCA and twice-monthly golf games with his grandson. Age, to him, is really just a number. “If you want something bad enough and you work hard enough you can achieve your goals,” Perillo says.  “You gotta keep active and not sit around all day.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

But the betting on Gaga’s field takeover also extends to her hair hue (blonde vs. “any other color”). What color Gatorade will the winning coach get doused with? Lime/green “liquid” vs yellow or orange are the leading contenders here, all at +300. However, just as many people think either Bill Belichick or Dan Quinn will merely get water dumped on them.

And I really really am a straight shooter and I really do admire what you've done musically andwhat you've had to endure personally.\" Brandy, 41, returned the compliment, saying, \"I have the utmost love and respect for you as well, for somebody to start at 12 years old.... The longevity of your career, nobody [knows] what you've been through.\" RELATED:Brandy Reveals Her Darkest Moment of Depression and How Daughter Sy'rai Saved Her Life The women kept it cordial and even held hands at points during the unusually long, three-hour battle. Both played their iconic songs, as well as their lesser-known gems; Brandy showed off \"Baby,\" \"Almost Doesn't Count,\" \"Full Moon,\" and even broke out herMoeshajournal with the poems. She dedicated \"Missing You\" to late performers likeChadwick Boseman, Kobe Bryant, Nipsey Hussle, Michael Jackson, and Whitney Houston. Monica effortlessly harmonized to some of her own jams with \"So Gone,\" \"Almost Doesn't Count,\" \"For You I Will,\" and \"Angel of Mine,\" among the mix. Still, fans commented that they sensed some awkwardness between the duo at times. At one point, Monica mentioned how she's matured from her days of \"kickin' in doors and smackin' chicks,\" leading Brandy to joke she was one of those chicks. Brandy and Monica also revealed that they hadn't talked in eight years before the battle. Their last collaboration came in 2012 when they recorded afollow-up single\"It All Belongs to Me,\" a female empowerment anthem. Lots of celebrities tuned into the highly anticipated livestream, including Snoop Dogg (who is Brandy's cousin), Keke Palmer, Missy Elliott, and even Michelle Obama. Vice Presidential candidate Kamala Harris also popped in for a virtual chat before the face-off to celebrate the ladies and encourage viewers to vote in the 2020 election. Monica released a new song, \"Trenches\" featuring Lil Baby, during the livestream, while Brandy trotted out \"Borderline\" fromher new albumb7. According to social media reactions, the singers were neck and neck the whole time, and people loved seeing the women patch things up and have fun throughout the night. \"People need this music,\" Brandy said about their Verzuz. \"People need to see us together, people need to see unity and celebration ... I'm just honored to be sitting next to you.\" They closed the reunion with — what else — \"The Boy is Mine.\" Brandy also explained she wanted Monica on the collaboration because \"it was missing you ... and you just took it to a different place.\" Related content: This Story Originally Appeared Onew\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: This article originally appeared on EW.com. Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration will take place Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C., but so far, the president-elect has had some difficulty assembling a star-powered lineup for the ceremony. Over the last month or so, more and more musicians have publicly declined to perform — even those who Trump has praised or have a previous relationship with the president-elect. In preparation for the inauguration, here’s a handy list of everyone who won’t perform for the president-elect. Andrea Bocelli The classical singer was one of the first names to emerge as an inauguration performer. In early December,PEOPLE reportedhe would sing a duet with young America’s Got Talent star Jackie Evancho, who has confirmed she will sing the national anthem. But shortly after, Bocelli’s teamofficially announcedhe was pulling out of the festivities, reportedly fearing backlash from Trump’s critics and political opponents. Elton John Elton John’s classic hits like “Tiny Dancer” and “Rocket Man” were consistently played at Trump campaign rallies (the songs almost always earned mention inlong feature stories), and the president-elect himself was known to watchold John concerts on his plane. A member of Trump’s inaugural committee told the BBC in late November that the artist would perform, but John, who fundraised for Hillary Clinton, quicklyshot downthe rumor. Céline Dion According toThe Wrap, Las Vegas casino mogul Steve Wynn reportedly promised Trump he could land Céline Dion as an inauguration performer. Dion, however, will not perform on Jan. 20 and Wynn’s reps denied any attempts were made by the businessman to get her on board. “Mr. Wynn was not asked to book specific performers for the inauguration, nor did he ever a make a commitment to find specific performers,” a rep said. Dion is scheduled to play at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on Jan. 20. Kanye West West may have gotten Trump to sign thepresident-elect’s TIME magazine cover, but he won’t be in Washington, D.C. to sing for the former reality television star. “No, No. Kanye and Donald are good friends,” Tom Barrack, chairman of Trump’s presidential inaugural committee,toldCNN. “Donald is a great admirer of Kanye, as we are all, but he is not performing at the inauguration.” Garth Brooks Brooks, a country superstar, was initially open to playing in Washington. “It’s always about serving. It’s what you do,”Brooks told TMZon Dec. 1, 2016. However, two weeks later, the “Friends in Low Places” musician rescinded his interest,according toThe Wrap. Rebecca Ferguson The British X-Factor alum seemed ready to perform at Trump’s inauguration, but any deal fell apartafter she insisted on singing “Strange Fruit.”An intensely political song made famous byBillie Holiday’s 1939 rendition, “Strange Fruit” is a haunting protest against the lynching of African-Americans. “There are many grey areas about the offer for me to perform that I’m unable to share right now, but I will not be singing,” the singer said in a statement in January. David Foster The award-winning music producer was rumored to play a pivotal role in organizing the inauguration and recruiting some of his star collaborators, but Foster quickly denied the story. “I was invited to participate and I politely declined,”Foster told PEOPLE in a statement. “I have no idea where this story came from.” Charlotte Church The award formost emphatic response to playing Trump’s inaugurationgoes to classical singer Charlotte Church, who responded to Trump himself directly on Twitter. “A simple Internet search would show I think you’re a tyrant,” Church tweeted at the president-elect, topping it off with a handful of poop emoji. KISS Whencornered by TMZabout whether KISS would play Trump’s inauguration, Gene Simmons’ wife Shannon Tweed shouted “no!” and said that the group had “politely declined” the offer. Simmons, for his part, said that the band would be touring Europe at the time anyway. Moby In addition to the inauguration ceremony itself, Trump’s team also needs to line up DJs and performers for the various inaugural balls to be held in Washington, D.C. Moby wrote on Instagram that he had been approached to DJ one of them. Like Rebecca Ferguson, hemade a very specific demand. “I guess I’d DJ at an inaugural ball if as payment #trump released his tax returns,” Moby wrote on Instagram. Idina Menzel The Tony-winning actress wasn’t necessary asked to perform at the inauguration, but she won’t do it anyway. Asked by Vanity Fair about Trump’s problems finding talent for Jan. 20, Menzel called it “karma, baby,” and added Trump should perform himself. “He probably thinks he has a great voice; he thinks he does everything great.” Rockettes/Mormon Tabernacle Choir Amidst all these denials and refusals, the Trump inaugural committee has been able to hold on to Evancho, the Radio City Rockettes, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. But despite serving as stalwarts for many past presidential inaugurations, even the latter two are showing signs of disdain. Mormon Tabernacle Choir singer Jan Chamberlinresigned from the grouprather than sing for Trump, while the Rockettes have beenracked by internal dissentover the performance. Amy Schumer, Katy Perry, Scarlett Johansson, Cher, America Ferrera… None of those famous names above have officially turned down Trump, but they won’t be at the inauguration. Instead, that group will hit the streets of Washington, D.C. on Jan. 21 to participate in the Women’s March on Washington. Other famous names planning to join in the march include Debra Messing, the cast of Orange Is the New Black, Frances McDormand, Julianne Moore, Olivia Wilde, Constance Wu, and many more.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Though Franken’s statement did not explicitly confess to groping or other inappropriate behavior, he acknowledged that some women felt disrespected by him, and apologized for that. “I’ve met tens of thousands of people and taken thousands of photographs, often in crowded and chaotic situations,” Franken said in the statement, per theAssociated Press. “I’m a warm person; I hug people. I’ve learned from recent stories that in some of those encounters, I crossed a line for some women — and I know that any number is too many. Some women have found my greetings or embraces for a hug or photo inappropriate, and I respect their feelings about that … I’ve thought a lot in recent days about how that could happen, and recognize that I need to be much more careful and sensitive in these situations. I feel terribly that I’ve made some women feel badly and for that I am so sorry, and I want to make sure that never happens again. And let me say again to Minnesotans that I’m sorry for putting them through this and I’m committed to regaining their trust.” Ever since several women came forward in October to accuse longtime Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment, there has beena seismic shift underway in American cultureregarding sexual violence.More and more powerful men in media and politicshave been accused of misconduct, andseveral have been fired from their high-profile jobs. Franken was first accused by L.A. radio host Leeann Tweeden, who posteda photoof him appearing to grab her breasts while on a USO tour in 2006.

Top Senate Democrats (including Franken’s Minnesota colleague, Sen. Amy Klobuchar) havesharply criticized Franken’s behaviorand say they stand with his accusers. Yet Franken’s latest statement offers no indication he plans on resigning.

Trump said he was tested both Wednesday and Thursday for the virus and both times were negative. Trump, Pence and senior aides had been tested weekly,CNNreported — part of a larger set of protocols designed to prevent either leader from contracting the virus, even as it has spread to other government officials around the world.

She addressed the news of her diagnosis on Twitter Friday. “Thank you all for your prayers and well wishes,” shewrote. “I’m doing well and look forward to getting back to work for the American people.” Earlier on Friday, White House press secretaryKayleigh McEnanyconfirmed that a member of Pence’s team tested positive for the coronavirus, but did not specify who the person was. The vice president's trip to Iowa was then delayed by more than an hour as six other Pence staffers, who had possibly been in contact with Miller, were removed from Air Force Two prior to takeoff.

Pence, less empowered than some past vice presidents, was chiefly a tireless defender for the Trump's policies and a bridge to the Republican Party's religious and more traditional wings.

The \"I Like It\" rapper shared some precious moments from her festive family celebration on her Instagram Stories. She uploaded adorable videos featuring her daughterKulture Kiari, 4, and sonWave Set, 15 months, both of whom she shares with Migos rapperOffset. In one video from Christmas Eve, Kulture looks overjoyed to unwrap a plush Minnie Mouse pillow, which she hugs as Cardi tells her, \"Daddy got that for you!\" Her camera then pans over to Offset, who smiles while filming his daughter open presents. \"You think you lit 'cause you got her something she like!\" the \"WAP\" rapper jokes to her husband. On Christmas morning, Wave received more presents than the toddler could seemingly handle. With some help, Cardi's baby boy unwrapped a box nearly as tall as him and bent down to take a closer look. \"You like it?\" Mom asks while filming her son, who stands up and turns away from the gift. When he walks further away, she playfully adds, \"You don't care? You over it?\" As Wave continues to move away from the wrapped boxes awaiting him, another person standing nearby asks, \"Are you over Christmas?\" As the other onlooking grown-ups laugh, the person adds, \"You got like 90 more gifts to open.\" But the abundance of holiday presents didn't stop there. On her Instagram Story, Cardi shared another video of someone appearing to play a virtual reality basketball game. With a headset on and controllers in hand, the kid shoots an invisible ball.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Looks do matter, at least when it comes to beets, carrots, apples and other fruits and vegetables. A whopping 20 billion pounds of misshapen produce deemed too \"ugly\" to be displayed in grocery stores around the world go to waste each year, according toFeeding America. Though packed with nutrition, these unwanted fruits and vegetables are left in farmers' fields or sent to landfills, where they decompose and produce methane, one of the most potent gases heating the planet to dangerous levels. Amy Keller came up with a sweet solution. In 1906, her family founded the Spangler Candy Co., maker of nostalgic treats such as Circus Peanuts, Sweethearts and 2 billion Dum Dums a year, making it the largest lollipop manufacturer in the world. Keller, who had her first Dum Dum when she was 1 year old — and whose favorite flavor is the mystery pop — is adding to her family's legacy with a new creation: FAVES byClimate Candy, her own brand of healthy, eco-friendly sweets. Made from \"perfectly imperfect\" but \"perfectly good\" misshapen fruits and vegetables, FAVES are delicious, nutritious and good for the planet, says Keller, Climate Candy's co-founder and CEO. With flavors such as cherry, strawberry, lemon and orange, \"when people try FAVES, they can't believe they're made out of fruits and vegetables,\" Keller tells PEOPLE. The sweetness comes from only fruits and vegetables, she says. \"We've told people, 'We imagine a world where fruits and vegetables taste like candy,'\" she adds. But that's not all. FAVES, which stands for \"Fruit and Vegetable Sweets,\" is helping to fight the climate crisis. It says so right on the candies' sustainable wrappers: \"We did it. We turned problems into candy, and now you can eat them.\" \"Unharvested produce,\" the packaging reads, \"wastes vital energy and contributes to climate change.\" For more about Climate Candy and how to reduce food waste,subscribe now to PEOPLEor pick up this week's issue, on newsstands Friday. Keller started thinking about ways to use all that unharvested produce when she visited theGlobal Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway,in 2018 with Kevin Wall — who produced theLive Earth climate benefit concertwithThe Climate Reality Projectfounder, former Vice President Al Gore — and Wall's wife, Dr. Susan Smalley, co-founder with her husband of PTK Capital. \"We went there to learn about food security, and I witnessed the United Nations installing generators, due to climate change, to keep the glaciers refrigerated for all of the seeds that feed the world,\" Keller says. \"While I was on the trip, I was also readingDrawdown: The Most Comprehensive Plan Ever Proposed to Reduce Global Warming by Paul Hawken,\" she continues. \"So then I was learning about how 40% of food is wasted globally. And so really the company business plan came together while I was in the Arctic Circle.\" With the help of her co-founders Wall and Smalley, Climate Candy was born. \"I knew there had to be a way to combine my passion for environmental issues and health with the family business creating sweet treats,\" says Keller, a longtime climate activist and seven-time Ironman triathlete. \"I was determined to create a business that could make a contribution to the planet and make a positive impact on people's lives and health while still allowing indulgence and the enjoyment we get from candy,\" she adds. FAVES, says Keller, \"gives people the opportunity to positively impact the world.\" By rescuing about 2.2 million fruits and vegetables a year, Climate Candy is reducing food waste by preventing unharvested produce from festering in landfills, according to Keller. \"If we could just cut food waste in half, it would reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 75 million metric tons every year,\" she says. That's a big number but, Keller adds, one person can make a difference. Each packet of the plant-based candy that's consumed \"means you've rescued one apple, two carrots, two strawberries, two cherries, along with slices of lemons, oranges, beets, sweet potatoes and pumpkins,\" she explains. With FAVES available onAmazonand other e-commerce sites such as Imperfect Foods, in retail stores such as Urban Outfitters, and at airport kiosks, it can add up quickly. They will be sold in stores such as The Vitamin Shoppe in June. A 2-ounce package sells for $3.99; a 4-ounce packet is $4.99. Climate Candy, which contains 96 percent imperfect fruits and vegetables, plans to introduce new flavors, too, including peach mango and blueberry raspberry. So what would Keller's late grandfather, Norman Spangler, a second-generation leader at her family's iconic candy company, say about his self-described \"disruptive granddaughter?\" \"The fact that we have the ability to instill fun and color into any moment with what we're doing is the same as when I was trading Dum Dums at the lunch table as a kid,\" she says. \"It's just that brief moment of joy and nostalgia.\" She remembers advice she once got from her grandfather, who told her \"not to eat the profit,\" she says. \"But that's really hard when you own a candy business.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The crucial Republican state may flip blue for the first time in nearly 30 years, though Biden's margin would require a recount Former Vice PresidentJoe Bidenhad pulled into a narrow lead overDonald Trumpin Georgia as of Friday — a victory that, if it holds, would see a crucial Republican state flip blue for the first time in nearly 30 years, underlining the extent to which the cities, suburbs and people of color there had repudiated the president. The margins between the candidates remain razor thin — about 1,500 votes as of Friday morning — which all but ensured a recount would be possible, according to state elections officials, who said the final result may not be known until later in the month. The delay in Georgia, officials have repeatedly explained, is largely due to the volume of mail ballots this year because of the novel coronavirus pandemic: some 1.25 million such votes were returned through Election Day, which amounts to about a quarter of all votes counted in the state so far. But as the vote counting continued into the third day after the presidential election, Biden's path to a win in Georgia — one of the country's most diverse states — has become clearer and clearer. While Trump racked up notable margins in the state's rural and Republican-leaning areas, Biden won even more convincingly in Atlanta and its suburbs as well as in Georgia's other urban areas, while decreasing Trump's share of the vote in many key Republican counties. After Trump earned clear wins in the key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Texas, Many Democrats rejoiced at the news in Georgia — which seemed to prove out the success of the Biden campaign's push to flip the state along with Arizona, where he was also narrowly ahead as of Friday. Those wins would only pad Biden's Electoral College victory, given his leads in the Midwestern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (The last time Georgia voted for a Democratic presidential nominee was for Bill Clinton, in 1992; before that, it was during Georgia native Jimmy Carter's two campaigns, in 1976 and 1980.) On social media, credit began cascading to Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia legislator-turned-voting rights activist who narrowly lost the state's 2018 race for governor and who has spent years organizing Democrats there and registering new voters. On Twitter on Friday, Abramsspotlightedthe work of others, including groups that supported turnout from Black, Latino and Asian voters. \"Let’s shout out those who’ve been in the trenches and deserve the plaudits for change,\" she wrote. President Trump has responded to the increasing reality of his defeat with defiance and deceit — saying in a Thursday night speech from the White House that the votes against him were fraudulent. Some Republican lawmakers in Georgia took up that evidence-free argument, appearing at a rally Thursday night in Atlanta along with Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., according toThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution. However, the state's top officials — Gov. Brian Kemp and Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, all of whom are Republicans — were absent, though Loeffler and Perdue posted social media messages calling for transparency and fairness in the elections andoffered other supportfor Trump. The president has likewise accused the elections in states where he is losing of being run by Democrats, though Georgia's top elections officials are all Republicans. On Friday morning one of those officials, Gabriel Sterling, provided an update on the remaining votes to be counted in Georgia. He told reporters there were some 4,100 votes remaining statewide, mostly in the Atlanta area, as well as an unknown number of properly postmarked military or overseas ballots that could be received by the end of Friday. Sterling noted the extremely small margin between the candidates — \"less than a large high school\" — underscored the importance of investigating any serious claim of fraud or other issue as well as ensuring every legally cast vote was counted correctly. But so far, he said, \"We’re not seeing widespread irregularities, we’re not seeing anything widespread.\" There are \"many, many safeguards\" to \"ensure the integrity of the vote\" in Georgia, he said. Earlier this week, he said their priority was precision. \"Fast is great and we appreciate fast,\" Sterling said. \"We more appreciate accuracy. Accuracy is going to be the bedrock upon which people will believe the outcome of these elections, be they on the winning side or the losing side.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Alejandra Campoverdi is a current congressional candidate, a former White House aide, an ex-waitress and a one-timeMaximmodel – all titles she’s glad to have held. The 37-year-old – who isrunning for California’s 34th district– opened up about the sexism she’s faced during her political career in anew essay forCosmopolitantitled “I Posed forMaximand I’m Running for Congress. It Shouldn’t Be That Shocking.” “I’m proud of the mosaic of experiences that make me who I am,” wrote Campoverdi. “My life experiences have forged me into a fighter and that’s why I decided that I won’t let others’ boxes stop me from doing what needs to be done — running for office, standing up to Trump and Republicans, and standing up for women in Los Angeles.” Campoverdi wrote that she started working at age 15, the daughter of a single mom who immigrated from Mexico. One of those early jobs was as a model. Eventually, Campoverdi found her way toPresident Obama‘s White House, but just a week into her position, photos from her old shoot forMaximsurfaced. “Right behind the photos followed the hotter, more humiliating blaze of unveiled snark that pointedly implied that I didn’t deserve what I’d accomplished and had been overambitious for even trying in the first place,” said Campoverdi, adding, “I was now stamped as the ‘White House Maxim Model.’ I had been reduced to a stereotype.” She continued, “After crying for a week, I put my head down and worked even harder. The only thing that ever got me anywhere was working hard, showing up when I said I would or earlier, and doing more than just the job I was hired to do. And that’s what I did for my next four years at the White House.” FROM COINAGE: This Is How Much It Would Cost to Paint the White House (And More Crazy Facts) Campoverdi is one of 23 candidates running to fill the seat vacated by now-California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, in the April 4 special election. The top two candidates will continue onto a runoff election in June. She wrote inCosmothat now, eight years on, she understands “a lot more about the systemic sexism in politics than the young woman who beat herself up and took all the shaming so personally.” Calling out “double standards,” Campoverdi said that she’s fighting back against the roles that women are sometimes typecast in, and notes that females shouldn’t have to choose between being intelligent and feminine. “The larger problem is our need for many more women — diverse, young, and from a range of perspectives — to run for office, now more than ever,” she said, adding, “Now more than ever, we must recognize and accept the complexity of real women, and celebrate them in their quest for leadership roles. Whole, multidimensional women. Please throw your name in the arena, whichever one you’re in — because it only gets better every time one of us tries.” In addition to her congressional run, Campoverdi is currently facing another challenge: a double mastectomy. She has a genetic mutation called BRCA2, which means she has an 85-percent likelihood of developing breast cancer. Campoverdi has decided to have the preventative procedure in two years. RELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack Speaking to PEOPLE earlier this week, Campoverdi said that she’s opening up about her decision to bring attention to the importance of health care. “Health care is a life or death issue for so many Americans, so many people in my district in Los Angeles,” Campoverdi told PEOPLE. “Sometimes we can get into debates that are very theoretical about issues, and forget that there’s a lot personally on the line for people every day — that every day someone doesn’t have access to health care, or that every day somebody has a bill that puts them in the position of going bankrupt.” She added, “I’m fine being vulnerable about [my BRCA2 status], because if it’s able to bring the attention back to people, which is what this is all about, then it’s worth it for me.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

According to a reliable source (ahem,Wikipedia), the magical phrase originates in Britain and North America, and its variants include “rabbit rabbit,” “rabbit, rabbit, rabbit,” “rabbits” or “white rabbits” and must be uttered upon waking on the first day of the month in order to ensure good luck for the rest of the month. While the exact origin of the superstition is unknown, the oldest record of it dates back to children, according to a 1909 edition of the quarterly scholarly journalNotes and Queriesand notated inA Dictionary of English Folklore: “My two daughters are in the habit of saying ‘Rabbits!’ on the first day of each month. The word must be spoken aloud, and be the first word said in the month. It brings luck for that month. Other children, I find, use the same formula.” Apparently the girls thought saying this phrase would result in the delivery of a gift before the month’s end, although the word “rabbit” at the time was also commonly used in conjunction with curse words and may be part of the ancient custom of swearing to ward off evil. Yet another belief is that speaking the words is a link to seasonal fertility. RELATED VIDEO: Who Knew Porcupines Could Be So Cute? Two books of the twentieth century, Robert Wilson Lynd’sSolomon in All His Glory(1922), and Trixie Belden’sThe Mystery of the Emeralds (1962),mention the phrase. More recently,Nickelodeon helped popularize the phrase in the 1990sas part of its “Nick Days” campaign. The kids’ cable channel celebrated “Rabbit Rabbit Day” as a holiday on the last day of each month, reminding viewers to say it the next day. Perhaps most importantly, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt is said to have believed in the power of the superstition. Supposedly,a news article from 1935 notes, “Even Mr. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, has confessed to a friend that he says ‘Rabbits’ on the first of every month — and, what is more, he would not think of omitting the utterance on any account.” Plus, the beloved comedian Gilda Radner said her own version of the phrase (“bunny, bunny”) to ensure “laughter, love and peace”according to NPR.(There’s also thisbook,Bunny, Bunny, about her.)

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Shortly after some of Donald Trump’s accusers called for acongressional investigation into their claims of sexual harassment and assault, agroup of Democratic lawmakerscalled on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to look into their claims. But with Republicans controlling both the houses of Congress—plus the executive branch of government—the chances for a Congressional inquiry already appear slim:  the committee’s chairman, RepresentativeTrey Gowdy (R-S.C.) shot down the request almost immediately, referring it to the Department of Justice, over which Trump has oversight. The decision, according to Politico,doesn’t sit well with Democrats, including the committee’s ranking Democrat Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who said sexual harassment allegations against the president are within the committee’s purview. Two Democratic lawmakers tried another route on Wednesday, calling on the U.S. Office of Government Ethics toinvestigate the claims of Trump’s sexual misconduct by 19 women. But the office’s former head, Walter Shaub, wrote in a tweet that while he shares “the frustration” of those in Congress “over the lack of investigation into serious allegations against” Trump, the office is not—nor should be—an investigative office. I share the frustration of these Members of Congress over the lack of investigation into serious allegations against POTUS, but OGE is not (& should not be) an investigative agency. This investigation should happen, but under our Constitution, it should be conducted by Congress.pic.twitter.com/wZA8sDo89b — Walter Shaub (@waltshaub)December 14, 2017 “This investigation should happen,” Shaun wrote, “but under our Constitution, it should be conducted by Congress.” Norm Eisen, an attorney who served as ethics chief for the Obama White House, says that Democrats on the Oversight committee can look at the allegations “on their own, though they do not have formal power to hold an official hearing or issue an official report absent majority (Republican) consent.” There are other House and Senate committees that could look into the matter, says Eisen, calling Gowdy’s referral to the Justice Department “all the more reason” for the DOJ to take up the matter. But with Republicans in power, an investigation by the Republican-controlled Congress and Justice Department “will be politicized,” says Richard Painter, the former George W. Bush White House Chief Ethics lawyer. Painter forsees that if there were a Congressional or Department of Justice investigation into Trump’s alleged sexual misconduct, Republicans would demand that all members of the House and Senate be investigated for behavior related to sexual harassment prior to taking office. “I think the Democrats are walking into a hornets nest,” Painter says. RELATED VIDEO: PEOPLE Writer Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack Democrats may have to win back power before a proper investigation of any kind is undertaken. “I am sure if Congress was not in the thrall of President Trump’s own party — which has shown a repeated propensity not to hold him accountable — there would be a congressional investigation that’s appropriate and proper,” says Eisen. Painter believes in Trump’s case, “the judicial process is the appropriate form of investigation of conduct prior to taking office” and cites the defamation lawsuit filed against Trump by formerApprenticecontestant Summer Zervos. Trump called Zervos a liar after she went public withallegations that he began kissing her very aggressivelyand put his hand on her breast without her consent in 2007. The lawsuit, notes Painter, could lead to depositions of Trump under oath, and if he lies, it could be grounds for impeachment, as it was for President Bill Clinton when he lied about his sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. Democrats, says Painter, have a much better chance of bringing about a successful investigation into Trump regarding issues involving abuse of executive power while he has been in office — including threats to the first amendment, Russian collusion, obstruction of justice, and violating the emoluments clause. “If at some point they want to have the women come forward, it’s indicative of his character,” Painter says. If there were a congressional investigation into Trump’s alleged sexual harassment and assault, what would it mean for the accusers? Eisen says remedies could range from fact-findings all the way up to impeachment. “At a minimum if they found the women’s claims were true and Trump was falsely denying them, they could make recommendations on how to remediate the hostile work environment,” says Eisen. “For example Trump should not be meeting alone with women, there should a chaperone.” Eisen says that Trump’s and the White House’s continued denial of the women’s claims — including White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ issuing a list of faulty “eyewitnesses” to dispute Trump’s accusers — “are very serious legal violations.” “The Senate and House findings in that regard could go up to the constitutional remedy” of impeachment, he says.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

One reporter that he was directly criticizing said he was right — to her credit. \"President Trump tells @nypost I am nothing like 50's American archetypal mom Donna Reed,\" CBS political reporter Paula ReidtweetedTuesday morning. \"Fact-check: True.\" Trump's comment came during an interview with thePostpublished on Tuesday during which he complained about reporters' attitudes and specifically called out Reid and her CBS News colleague Weijia Jiang. “It wasn’t Donna Reed, I can tell you that,” Trump, 73, told the paper, referring to theIt's a Wonderful LifeandFrom Here to Eternitystar, who also appeared inThe Donna Reed Show. ThePostinterview does not expand on his comparison, though it appeared to be about the journalists' tone. RELATED:Donald Trump Complains That He’s Been ‘Treated Worse’ Than Assassinated President Abraham Lincoln The president added: “Paula Reid, she’s sitting there and I say, ‘How angry. I mean, what’s the purpose?’ They’re not even tough questions, but you see the attitude of these people, it’s like incredible.\" Trump's tumultuous relationship with the media was on full display throughout April, during his daily coronavirus task force briefings. He often argued with and scolded reporters — his voice sometimes rising almost to a yell — about what he said were unfavorable questions and coverage and a lack of congratulations over his choices in responding to the pandemic. In addition to contentious exchanges with Reid and Jiang — who has said a White House official privately referred to the virus as \"kung flu\" — Trump has had sharp words for CNN's Kaitlin Collins and PBS' Yomiche Alcindor, as well as male reporters like Jim Acosta. During anApril 23 briefing, Trump physically turned away from Collins and called CNN \"fake news.\" \"Don't talk to me,\" Trump told her. At other times, he told reporters — men and women — to be quiet and labeled their questions \"nasty.\" He has a long history of referring to news media he doesn't like in bombastic terms such as \"the enemy of the people.\" He similarly has a long history of denigrating women with whom he disagrees, sometimes in intimately insulting terms. Critics quickly linked hisPostinterview to those examples. \"He finally confirmed what we modern day women always knew: He expects women to be out of a 1950’s sitcom. In their place. Quiet. Home Makers,\" CNN commentator Sophia Nelsontweetedon Tuesday. Other social media users were quick to point out that Reed, an Academy Award-winning actress who died in 1986, was a progressive celebrity for her time whose politics differed from the image Trump had in his head. \"Reality check,\"New Yorkerwriter Jane Mayertweeted. \"Donna Reed was an anti- war and pro- civil rights activist and professional actor who only played a housewife on TV.\" Trump tweeted in 2018 that pornographic actress Stephanie Clifford — known professional as Stormy Daniels — was a \"horseface\"andhas saidRosie O'Donnell, with whom he regularly fought, had \"a fat, ugly face.” He said former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly had \"blood coming out of her wherever\" after she was co-moderating a 2015 Republican primary debate where she asked him about his attitudes toward women. And in 2017 he claimed that MSNBC's \"low I.Q.\" Mika Brzezinski once came to him while \"bleeding badly from a face-lift.\" Brzezinski told PEOPLE afterward: \"Trump targets anything that pricks his ego. It is very sad that the leader of the free world can be played like a fiddle.\" Trump similarly made fun of onetime rival Sen.

Grab them by the p----. You can do anything.\" After Trump's \"horseface\" insult about Clifford, former Rep. Ryan Costello — a Republican who retired from Congress in 2019 —tweetedthat Trump's repeated misogynistic actions were \"unbecoming\" and \"embarrassing.\" “To say this is unbecoming of any man, let alone the POTUS, is a vast understatement,” Costello wrote then. “And to say this enables teenage boys to feel they have a license to refer to girls with (sic) such names is obvious. It’s all very embarrassing.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

While the president rode with King Charles and Queen Camilla in the Irish State Coach, which is the traditional coach the monarch uses to travel from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster to formally open the new legislative session of the U.K. Parliament.

Meanwhile, Kate andPrince Williamwere in the Australian State Coach with South Africa's Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor. The carriage was a gift toQueen Elizabethfrom Australia in May 1988 to mark the Australian Bicentennial. The ride up the famous Mall, which was decorated with the flags of the two countries, took place after a parade of hundreds of soldiers and music on Horse Guards Parade earlier.

She doesn’t live a lavish life and can very rarely pick up a check at dinner,” one friend tells Page Six. “Don Jr. was never generous with money,” adds a second source. “Vanessa has had to rely on her mother for financial help for her personal needs.” Vanessa’s spokesperson denied the claims to Page Six. The couple — who share five children: Kai, 10, Donald III, 9, Tristan, 6, Spencer, 5, and Chloe, 3 — “have tremendous respect for each other and always have,” the spokesperson said. “The notion that she has had to rely on her family for assistance is absolutely false and utterly ridiculous.” A source who sometimes socializes with Vanessa and Trump Jr. tells PEOPLE that the couple had been living “separate lives” for a while. “Even before all this Trump presidency stuff started, they weren’t good and their marriage was strained,” the PEOPLE source says. Page Six also reported Monday thatTrump Jr. had an affairwith former Danity Kane singer andCelebrity Apprenticecontestant Aubrey O’Day while he was serving as an adviser forCelebrity Apprenticein 2011. The outlet cited anonymous sources who said that Trump Jr., 40, and O’Day, 34, a former singer in the girl group Danity Kane, had rendezvous in multiple cities during their alleged affair and wrote each other love letters. The sources also said that Trump Jr. told his wife he planned to leave her for O’Day and that Vanessa was “devastated” by the news. One source said the alleged affair marked the beginning of the end for Trump Jr.’s marriage and said Vanessa planned to leave her husband then. O’Day’s manager, Steven Grossman, told PEOPLE that she is not commenting at this time. A spokesperson for Trump Jr. did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

About 140 migrants from countries in Central and South America and the Caribbean arrived in D.C. from Texas, Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network organizer Madhvi Bahl told NBC News, calling the incident \"awful.\" Some of the migrants that arrived had to battle the 18-degree weather wearing only t-shirts, according toCNN, and they were eventually given blankets and taken to local shelters in the area. \"The D.C. community has been welcoming buses from Texas anytime they've come since April. Christmas Eve and freezing cold weather is no different,\" Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid Network volunteer Amy Fischer told CNN. \"We are always here welcoming folks with open arms.\" The White House placed the blame on Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who has sent busses of migrants to northern cities in the past, though it has not been confirmed that Abbott send the buses that wound up at Harris' residence. In a statement, the White House called the deployment of the buses a \"cruel, dangerous and shameful stunt.\" \"Governor Abbott abandoned children on the side of the road in below freezing temperatures on Christmas Eve without coordinating with any Federal or local authorities,\" White House spokesperson Abdullah Hasan said in a statement to news outlets. \"As we have repeatedly said, we are willing to work with anyone – Republican or Democrat alike – on real solutions, like the comprehensive immigration reform and border security measures President Biden sent to Congress on his first day in office, but these political games accomplish nothing and only put lives in danger,\" Hasan continued.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: E. Jean Carroll, the formerElleadvice columnist who filed suit against Donald Trump on allegations of rape and defamation, took the stand on Wednesday — just day two of the civil trial in New York City. \"I'm here because Donald Trump raped me,\" Carroll testified on the stand, according to multiple news outlets, \"and when I wrote about it, he said it didn't happen.\" (Trump continues to stand by his denial.) \"He lied and shattered my reputation, and I'm here to try and get my life back,\" she added. Carroll, 79, filed suit against the now 76-year-old former president under New York state's Adult Survivors Act, which creates a one-year lookback window for survivors of sexual abuse to file claims otherwise barred by the statute of limitations. Her suit alleged that \"roughly 27 years ago, playful banter at the luxury department store Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in New York City took a dark turn when Defendant Donald J. Trump seized Plaintiff E. Jean Carroll, forced her up against a dressing room wall, pinned her in place with his shoulder, and raped her.\" In court on Wednesday, Carroll elaborated on the alleged assault in explicit detail, saying that she found Trump attractive and \"personable\" before things took a dark turn,The Washington Postreports. She testified that she ultimately escaped the situation by kneeing Trump and pushing him away. According to her testimony, Carroll has not had a romantic relationship — or sex — since the alleged assault. \"The reason is because Donald Trump raped me,\" she said, according to thePost. \"I couldn't force myself to show [another] man that I liked that I liked him; it just led to terrible consequences.\" Carroll testified that she felt guilt for flirting with Trump before the alleged attack and did not file a police report at the time partly because she blamed herself, the outlet reports. She later said that she was fired byEllemagazine for accusing Trump of the incident later on, and subsequently lost the audience that kept her career afloat: \"It's been a huge loss, and I'm slowly building it back.\" On Wednesday, Trump ranted on Truth Social about the allegations against him. \"The E. Jean Carroll case, Ms. Bergdorf Goodman, is a made up SCAM. Her lawyer is a political operative, financed by a big political donor that they said didn't exist, only to get caught lying about that,\" he wrote, in part. In another post, he wrote: \"Does anybody believe that I would take a then almost 60 year old woman that I didn't know, from the front door of a very crowded department store, (with me being very well known, to put it mildly!), into a tiny dressing room, and …. her. She didn't scream? There are no witnesses? Nobody saw this?\" Trump has denied Carroll's claims of assault for years, saying ina 2019 interview: \"No. 1: She's not my type\" and, further, that he had \"never met this person in my life.\" (The two have been photographed together, though Trump said that was an incidental moment.) More recently, an attorney for Trump told outlets including the Associated Press that the case is \"an abuse\" of the new New York law. \"While I respect and admire individuals that come forward, this case is unfortunately an abuse of the purpose of this Act which creates a terrible precedent and runs the risk of delegitimizing the credibility of actual victims,\" Trump attorney Alina Habba said. As the now-unfolding trial is taking place in federal court, it will not be televised — meaning the details from the case are coming via reporters in the courtroom. NPR reports that the trial is expected to last roughly a week, and that \"damages could run to tens of millions of dollars\" if Trump is found to be at fault. It would also be the first time Trump — who has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of women — is held legally responsible for sexual misconduct.

According to court documents  obtained byTMZandEntertainment Tonight, she will plead guilty to one count of disorderly conduct in return for one year of unsupervised probation. Woodley’s rep did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment. TheBig Little Liesactress was arrested in October while protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline along with over a hundred other activists in North Dakota. Twenty-seven other protests were also arrested that day. On a recent appearance onThe Late Show,Woodley talked about her work protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline in Standing Rock, North Dakota — and admitted she wished her mug shot turned out better, after it went viral. “I wish I’d known that this was going to be as public as it was,”she told host Stephen Colbertas he held the picture up for the audience to see. “I would have made, like, a face. I’m just looking at the person, like, ‘Are you kidding me right now?’ ” Woodley has been one of themost vocalcelebritiesprotestingthe construction of the pipeline. During her October arrest, when she was charged withtrespassing and engaging in a riot, Woodley livestreamed the incident on Facebook. In the widely circulated video, she is seen handing the phone to her mom, who continued to stream her daughter’s arrest — a move Woodley later realized was probably hard for her mother. Shailene Woodley Released From Jail After Being Arrested For Criminal Trespassing “I handed her my phone and I was like, ‘Keep recording,’ ” she recalled, adding that her mom looked completely shocked. “I can’t imagine what it would be like to watch your daughter be handcuffed and taken away.” And although President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing for construction on the pipeline to move forward, the actress still urged people tocontinue protesting. “The front lines don’t necessarily have to be in North Dakota,” she said. “The front lines can be wherever you are. You can create a protest in New York City, because protests are about awareness and about people coming together.” After the show, the actress surprised fans waiting outside in freezing New York temperatures with donuts and other baked goods, passing them out to those standing patiently behind barricades.

Speaking withGood Morning Britainhost Piers Morgan last week during Trump’s stacked U.K. trip, the president was asked whether he’ll run for re-election. “Well, I fully intend to,” Trump — now 72 after becoming the oldest U.S. president ever elected at 70 — told Morgan in the televised interview, which aired Monday in the U.K. “It seems like everyone wants me to.” But earlier in the conversation, Trump seemed to oddly admit he might not be on the ballot. “Well, you never know, er, what happens with health and other things. I mean, you know, let’s face it…” said Trump before Morgan interjected. “You fit? You look fit,” Morgan told Trump. “I feel good,” replied Trump, who reportedly made changes to his diet in May following his years-long, well-documentedlove affair with fast food. Candidate Trump famously once ordered a2,530-calorie McDonald’s dinneron the 2016 campaign trail, according toLet Trump Be Trump, the book by the now-president’s ex-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and another ex-top aide, David Bossie. RELATED: Donald Trump Sides With Vladimir Putin Over Russia’s Cyber Attack on U.S. Elections: ‘A Good Competitor He Is’ The president had a complete physical in January, after which former White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson — whofaced shocking allegations of misconduct in April after Trump nominated him for Veterans Affairs secretary— said Trump was “currently very healthy,” but “would benefit from a diet that is lower in fat and carbohydrates, and from a routine exercise regimen.” The now-embattled physician also said Trump’s cholesterol is slightly elevated, but he was prescribed Crestor to address that, and otherwise “his cardiac health is excellent.” Trump also told Morgan he doesn’t feel threatened by potential Democrat opponents. “I know ’em all,” he said. “I don’t see anybody.” The president later added, “So far, they do not have the right candidate.” As for his chances of re-election, anaverage of the latest polls calculated by pollster Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEightputs Trump’s approval rating at 42 percent, though pollster Mark Penn pointed out toThe Hilllast week thatTrump’s approval rating has been ticking upas the nation gears up for the 2018 midterm elections. What’s more, CNN reported Friday that “Trump is more popular among Republicansnow than President Barack Obama was among Democrats at this point in his presidency.” Historically, though, the odds are not in Trump’s favor: Of the first 43 American presidents, just 15 — including the last three — have won a consecutive term. Trump’s previous statements have also prompted speculation about whether he actually wants to run for re-election. “I loved my previous life,” he told Reuters in April 2017. “I had so many things going … this is more work than in my previous life.” Commenting on the demands of the job, Trump said,“I thought it would be easier.” “I’m a details oriented person. I think you would say that, but I do miss my old life,” Trump explained to Reuters. “I like to work, so that’s not a problem, but this is actually more work.” He added: “And while I had very little privacy in my old life, because you know I’ve been famous for a long time … this is much less privacy than I’ve ever seen before.” Ivana Trump, Trump’s ex-wife and the mother to three of his five children, echoed the sentiment that November. “I think he’s missing a little bit of his old life,”she said onThe Ray D’Arcy Showin Ireland. “You know he was in Trump Tower, and he would go to Mar-a-Lago, he would go to play golf on Westchester, and things like that. Now from 8 o’clock in the morning to midnight, he’s working, working, working and everybody shoves at him the problem of the country.” She got laughs from the audience when she added: “I don’t envy him, I think he must be freaking exhausted.” The president’s interview with Morgan is the latest headline to come from his trip to the U.K., where he hasfaced mass protestswhile meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May about U.S.-Great Britain trade policy and criticism forawkwardly blocking Queen Elizabeth during their first-ever meeting. On Saturday, Trump fit in a round of golf at his Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland, where a group of nearby protestors chanted, “No Trump, no KKK, no racist USA.” In avideo shared on social mediaby Frankie McCamley, a reporter for the BBC, Trump could be seen waving and walking near the protestors to acknowledge them before turning back to resume his game.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: President-elect Donald Trumptook the podium at his first press conference since his upset victory in the November election and formally addressed the recent publication of an unsubstantiated dossier of reports about the 70-year-old’s dealings with — and alleged personal behavior in — Russia. “I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies – who knows, but maybe the intelligence agencies, which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they did do that, a tremendous blot,” Trump said from Trump Tower on Wednesday. “Because a thing like that should have never been written – it should never have been had. It shouldn’t certainly have never been released.” On Tuesday, Buzzfeed Newspublished a 35-page documentcontaining unsubstantiated claims about Trump’s alleged dealings with the Russian government, purported to be prepared by a former British intelligence officer, according toTheNew York Times. According to CNN, U.S. intelligence officials briefed President Obama and Trump on Friday on a two-page summary of the allegations. Trump said he’s not allowed to talk about what happened in his highly classified briefing. But, he added, “I think it’s a disgrace that information would be let out. I saw the information, I read the information —outside of that meeting — it’s all fake news. It’s phony stuff. It didn’t happen.” He blamed “sick people and they put that crap together.” Donald Trump refuses to take a question from CNN's Senior White House Correspondent@Acostahttps://t.co/SYIPLekALGhttps://t.co/Im5Dlc38B4 — CNN (@CNN)January 11, 2017 Trump later had a shouting match with CNN’s Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta, who repeatedly spoke out to try and ask a question while Trump admonished him as a member of the “fake news.” Later, Acosta said on CNN of the incident, “I felt it was only fair that if our news organization was going to be attacked that we got to ask a follow-up question,” adding that Sean Spicer, Trump’sincoming White House press secretary, threatened to throw him out of the press conference if he “did that again.” In response, CNN issued a statement on Wednesday, saying, in part, “CNN’s decision to publish carefully sourced reporting about the operations of our government is vastly different than Buzzfeed’s decision to publish unsubstantiated memos. Trump’s team knows this. They are using Buzzfeed’s decision to deflect from CNN’s reporting, which has been matched by the other major news organizations. We are fully confident in our reporting.” Statement from CNN:pic.twitter.com/WttyOCxQxp — CNN Communications (@CNNPR)January 11, 2017 Later in the press conference, Trump was asked why he referenced Nazi Germany in a tweet earlier Wednesday about the leaked report of allegedly compromising intelligence. Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)January 11, 2017 “I think it was disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and a disgrace … and that’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do,” he said. Spicer called it “frankly outrageous and highly irresponsible” journalism, and called Buzzfeed “a left-wing blog that was openly hostile” to Trump’s candidacy in the 2016 campaign, later adding that the organization is a “failing pile of garbage.” “The fact that Buzzfeed and CNN made the decision to run [the story] …is a sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks. The report is not an intelligence report, plain and simple.” Vice President-Elect Mike Pence, who stepped to the mic just before Trump, called the published reports an effort to “delegitimize and demonize” the incoming president. While Trump continued to chafe at U.S.intelligence findingsthat Russians were behind last year’shacking of the Democratic PartyandHillary Clintoncampaign email accounts in order to influence the election in Trump’s favor, the president-elect finally acknowledged: “As far as hacking, I think it was Russia but I think we also get hacked by other countries,  other people.” The president-elect bristled at a question about conclusions by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election was meant to favor Trump: “If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what folks? That’s called an asset, not a liability. I don’t know that I’m going to get along with Vladimir Putin. I hope I do, but there’s a good chance I won’t.” RELATED VIDEO: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Assault He added, “And if I don’t, do you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Gimme a break.” As for the long lag between his last press conference and this one, Trump said: “We stopped giving [press conferences] because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news.” Trump’s opening praise for the news outlets that did not run the most recent reports is in stark contrast to statements the president-elect made in recent weeks. “I just want to compliment many other people in the room: I have great respect for the news and great respect for freedom of the press and all of that,” he told the reporters on Wednesday. However, just three days earlier hewrote on Twitter, “Media is fake!” AP Photo/Evan Vucci As for his much-heralded campaign promise to build a wall between the United States and Mexico and make Mexico pay for it, Trump affirmed Wednesday recent reports that American taxpayers would initially foot the bill. “I want to get the wall started, I don’t want to wait a year and a half while I get my deal with Mexico… Mexico will pay for the wall but it will be reimbursed.” Trump further promised to name his pick for the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by late Justice Antonin Scalia in the first days of his presidency. He also touched on the thorny policy question of what to do with President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, through which millions of Americans have their health insurance. Trump quashed speculation that his administration would take its time with the matter. Instead, he promised to act as soon as his nominee to head Health and Human Services – Representative Tom Price of Georgia – is confirmed by the Senate. “We’re going to do repeal and replace” essentially simultaneously, Trump promised without any detail. “Probably the same day, could be the same hour… Very complicated stuff.” Trump lawyer Sheri A. Dillon of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP also spoke for some time during the press conference, detailing the president-elect’s plans to separate from his global business dealings. Dillon said that Trump’s assets are being transferred into a trust, and his sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump, Jr., will take over. Further, an ethics adviser will be brought on. She said that Trump’s daughter,Ivanka Trump, “will have no further involvement” with the organization. Trump ended the conference with a callback to hisApprenticedays, saying he would tell his sons “you’re fired” if they don’t handle his business dealings well.

Theletterfrom the group Lawyers Defending American Democracy, initially posted Thursday, calls on “bar disciplinary authorities” to investigate the lawyers' recent behavior. “A license to practice law is not a license to lie to the public on behalf of a client,” reads the letter, which has so far been signed by former federal lawyers, judges and current legal professors from around the country. “The conduct of Mr. Giuliani and his colleagues is a disgrace,” the lawyers add, accusing Trump’s team of conduct that “demeans the legal profession.” Giuliani — who wasreportedly hospitalizedwith anovel coronavirus (COVID-19)infection at Georgetown University Medical Center  in Washington, D.C. — has recently led the president’s evidence-free arguments that the 2020 election was “stolen” from him and “rigged.” Trump and his allies have sought strikingly undemocratic relief from authorities, calling at various times for a new election, for hundreds of thousands of votes to be invalidated and for the various state results to be ignored entirely. RELATED:Trump's Legal Team Drops Attorney Who Spread Bizarre Conspiracy Theories of How He Lost to Biden But neither the president nor his lawyers have so far succeeded in convincing the courts or any state legislatures to intervene and overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s win over Trump, 74. Conspicuously, some of the campaign’s claims made in splashy press conferences have not been echoed in court, under questioning from a judge. Some courtshave ruled against Trumpin blunt language: \"Plaintiff failed to follow clear law in Michigan relative to such matters,\" a ruling last weekstated. A Pennsylvania judge in late Novemberfoundthat, in one suit, the Trump team had also given \"strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations ... unsupported by evidence.\" An appellate judge in Wisconsin was equally withering,rulingon Friday that a Trump aligned-group's complaint \"falls far short of the kind of compelling evidence and legal support we would undoubtedly need to countenance the court-ordered disenfranchisement of every Wisconsin voter.\" Giuliani, 76, meanwhile has held a number of headline-grabbing news conferences since Trump’s election loss, including at Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia — not the upscale hotel chain, the presidentclarifiedon Twitter — as well as one more recently in Washington, D.C., where he appeared to sweat through his hair dye. Last month, the Trump campaign also distanced itself from attorney Sidney Powell, who had been identified as a member of the president's legal team but went on to make a series of bizarre, conspiratorial claims about the election. The lawyers criticizing Trump wrote in their letter that “Mr. Giuliani’s aim is obvious: to fuel Mr. Trump’s campaign to delegitimize the outcome of the election ... Lawyers who lie to advance the partisan interest of a politician or any client dishonor the constitutional system they’ve sworn to uphold, the legal profession and themselves.” RELATED:Rudy Giuliani Says He's 'Getting Great Care' After Being Reportedly Hospitalized with COVID-19 The lawyers’ letter also called out another Trump attorney, Joseph DiGenova, who said during a cable TV interview in late November that Christopher Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, should be “taken out at dawn and shot.” RELATED:Woman Goes Viral for Bizarre Appearance at Trump Election Hearing in Michigan Krebs,who was fired by Trumpon Nov. 17 after contradicting his election-security claims, filed a defamation lawsuit against DiGenova and the campaign on Tuesday,The Washington Postreported.

Last month, Farhadi made headlines when he declared he wouldsit out the Oscarsto protest “the unjust circumstances” of Trump’s executive order blocking citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries — including Fahardi’s native Iran — from entering the United States. The ban has since been halted by judicial decisions, but Farhadi has maintained his position. Read the filmmakers’ full statement below,viaVariety: On behalf of all nominees, we would like to express our unanimous and emphatic disapproval of the climate of fanaticism and nationalism we see today in the U.S. and in so many other countries, in parts of the population and, most unfortunately of all, among leading politicians. The fear generated by dividing us into genders, colors, religions and sexualities as a means to justify violence destroys the things that we depend on – not only as artists but as humans: the diversity of cultures, the chance to be enriched by something seemingly “foreign” and the belief that human encounters can change us for the better. These divisive walls prevent people from experiencing something simple but fundamental: from discovering that we are all not so different. So we’ve asked ourselves: What can cinema do? Although we don’t want to overestimate the power of movies, we do believe that no other medium can offer such deep insight into other people’s circumstances and transform feelings of unfamiliarity into curiosity, empathy and compassion – even for those we have been told are our enemies. Regardless of who wins the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on Sunday, we refuse to think in terms of borders. We believe there is no best country, best gender, best religion or best color. We want this award to stand as a symbol of the unity between nations and the freedom of the arts. Human rights are not something you have to apply for. They simply exist – for everybody. For this reason, we dedicate this award to all the people, artists, journalists and activists who are working to foster unity and understanding, and who uphold freedom of expression and human dignity – values whose protection is now more important than ever. By dedicating the Oscar to them, we wish to express to them our deep respect and solidarity.

Frederick opens up about his friendship with the lateBlack Pantherstar: \"He was very much about betterment of people\" As fans around the world continue to mourn the sudden death ofBlack PantherstarChadwick Boseman, those who knew him best are sharing their heartfelt tributes and fond memories of the groundbreaking actor. Howard UniversityPresident Wayne A. I. Frederickformed a special bond with Boseman, a Howard alum, after inviting him to be the school's commencement speaker on May 15, 2018. Frederick, who holds an MD and MBA, is a practicing surgical oncologist who treats patients with colon cancer. He, like the rest of the world, was shocked to learn Boseman had died after a four-year battle with the disease at age 43 on Aug. 28. \"I am a practicing GI [gastrointestinal] surgical oncologist. I actually take care of patients with colon cancers that are stage IV that have spread to the liver and other areas. It was not only shocking but it was also, in some ways inspiring as I think about what those patients go through. I understand that intimately. I understand how you can have good days and bad days while taking chemotherapy, how your energy levels can change, how your mood can change, how even the daunting nature of such a very difficult diagnosis can really impact how you interact with others. The fact that he could insulate those urges from how he presented himself on a day to day basis is an amazing tribute to the fact that he was always considerate of others. He always put others first and was as selfless a human being as you can have.\" RELATED: Black Panther Producer Remembers Chadwick Boseman's Moving Last Text About Giving Back to Sick Kids He adds: \"There was absolutely no inclination [of his illness]. He never alluded to it, and he knew what I did as well, so you would think if he had any tendency to be concerned or to put himself first, it would have been easy for him to even run that scenario by me. He didn’t.\" Frederick says that Boseman's selflessness never wavered. \"Recognizing as well that he was also very private, but at the same time it just says a lot about him,\" adds Frederick. \"He didn’t make any excuses. He always showed up. He was always dedicated to what we were trying to do and accomplish together and never once said, 'I can’t do this because I’m busy, I’m going to be shooting.' He made himself available. I think that says a lot. It’s a great example for all of us, we can get so self-absorbed and I think he has taught us that the best thing we can do is to make ourselves available to others.\" Frederick says he was inspired by how Boseman always seemed to be thinking of others before himself. \"He was very much about betterment of people, and especially people of the African diaspora. He recognized their barriers and obstacles in the way of African Americans and in particular people of the African diaspora. He recognized his own journey had those obstacles and obstacles that he was able to overcome. I think he also felt strongly that part of what he was called to do as well was to make sure that he ease the path for others who may come behind him, in the same manner in which people made the path for him better.\" RELATED: Chadwick Boseman’s Lasting Legacy: PEOPLE Cover Honors Star After His Death from Colon Cancer Looking back on Boseman's powerful commencement speech, Frederick says \"it was a special day\" for the actor. \"When I got into the car with him he was nervous, which really surprised me,\" recalls Frederick. \"But coming back home is always different, there is so much emotion involved and he really put his heart and soul into that speech and the reception was incredible. The students and their families were really really excited to see them. I think he was also really humbled by the reception that he received as well.\" Before his death, Boseman was working with Frederick to develop some programs for the students at Howard, which Frederick says he will put in place. \"Since his passing as well, just in the past 24-48 hours, there are lots of alumni who’ve contacted me and lots of people I’ve been in touch with who are seeking ways to memorialize him,\" adds Frederick. \"We’re going to be thoughtful as a university to make sure we do that in the most dignified manner, and in a way that really embodies what he was about and who he was as a human being, there’s no doubt about that.\" Frederick says he hopes that people will hold onto the example Boseman set for others and continue to be inspired by it. \"I still feel that the most important thing about him was how well he treated each individual person and I can’t overemphasize that,\" he says. \"Our country is in a difficult situation right now, for more reasons than one, there’s a lot of reasons for us to pull apart from others – from the pandemic and having to socially distance a lot, to social justice issues that we have, for us to be so suspicious of one other and apprehensive. I hope that we will all take away from this young man’s life that at the end of the day, love conquers all and our ability to embrace that and see it in each other, ultimately, is the answer for so much of what ails us.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

At the center of the film is a charming conversation with fellow 91-year-old Sir David Attenborough about the Queen’s love of trees and her hope for the future. She talks about planting trees in her back garden for each of her four children — Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward — and reveals there are 1,400 trees in the palace grounds.

While Obama, 58, has never openly expressed a desire for a position on the Supreme Court, his credentials would make him a worthy candidate. As noted byFox News, he became the first African American to be named president of the Harvard Law Review, and he worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago.

RELATED:CDC Director Says U.S. Could 'Completely Lose' Progress with COVID-19 as More Variants Continue to Spread \"But it's not enough to have the vaccine supply.  We need vaccinators — people to put the shots in people's arms, millions of Americans' arms,\" he noted. As part of the president's push to reopen schools, Biden also announced that he would be directing states to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K through 12 educators and staff and child-care workers. \"So as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of our schools, let's treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is,\" he said. While Biden said \"not every educator will be able to get their appointment in the first week\" of March, he called for every teacher and child-care worker to receive at least one dose of a vaccine by the end of the month. RELATED:Competitors Merck and Johnson & Johnson Will Partner to Increase Production of COVID Vaccine Though the president said the nation is \"moving in the right direction,\" he urged the public to continue to be vigilant about COVID-19 safety precautions. \"I have to be honest with you: This fight is far from over...Though we celebrate the news of the third vaccine, I urge all Americans: Please keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, wear masks—keep wearing them, get vaccinated when it's your turn.  Now is not the time to let up,\" he said. \"There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can't assume that,\" he added. \"We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another.  That's how we're going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy going again, and get back to our loved ones.\" As of Wednesday morning, there have been more than 28.7 million cases of COVID-19 and at least 515,710 deaths in the U.S., according to data from theNew York Times.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Trump has denied that he had COVID prior to or while debating Biden Donald Trumptested positive for COVID-19 three days before he facedJoe Bidenin their first presidential debate, the former president's White House Chief of StaffMark Meadowsalleges in a new book. InThe Chief's Chief, an upcoming memoir by Meadows, he writes that Trump initially received results on Sept. 26, 2020 that indicated he had contracted the virus. In a second test, Trump tested negative, Meadows writes — using those results, rather than the positive test, \"to press on as if nothing had happened,\"according toThe Guardian, which obtained a copy of the book. A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment regarding the Meadows book (which the former president hailed in October as \"fantastic.\") In a statement, Trump responded to the latest headline from the former aide's tell-all by ignoring its substance — that he received a positive test result and carried on as usual — and instead called any claims that he had COVID prior to or during the debate \"fake news.\" \"The story of me having COVID prior to, or during, the first debate is Fake News,\" Trump said in a statement,The Independentreported. \"In fact, a test revealed that I did not have COVID prior to the debate.\" Meadows writes that he noticed the president was \"a little tired\" and thought he might have a \"slight cold\" as he was preparing to leave Washington to attend a rally in Middletown, Penn., on the day of his initial positive test. \"Stop the president from leaving,\" Meadows writes White House physician Sean Conley said over the phone. \"He just tested positive for COVID.\" It was too late to stop the president's departure but Meadows writes that he reached his boss by phone on Air Force One to deliver the news. \"Mr. President,\" Meadows writes inThe Chief's Chief, \"I've got some bad news. You've tested positive for COVID-19.\" RELATED:The Timeline of Events Leading Up to Donald Trump's Announcement He Tested Positive for COVID-19 Meadows writes that Trump's reply \"rhyme[d] with 'Oh spit, you've gotta be trucking lidding me,'\" theGuardianreports. He also said the White House was shocked to find out that the president had tested positive, despite awell-attended eventin the Rose Garden for Supreme Court nomineeAmy Coney Barrettthat very day. Dr. AnthonyFauci called it a \"superspreader event\"andThe New York Timesreported that11 people were diagnosed with COVIDafter attending, including Trump. Immediately following the positive results, which were not disclosed to the press or the public, Trump was quickly given another, more accurate test, according to Meadows, who writes that after a \"brief but tense wait\" the results came back negative. Meadows writes that he could \"almost hear the collective 'Thank God' that echoed through the cabin\" of the presidential plane. Still, the chief of staff told people in the president's immediate circle to \"treat him as if he was positive\" during the trip to Pennsylvania. But Trump, he writes, assumed the negative results gave him \"permission\" to go on as usual, meeting with military families at the White House on Sept. 27, appearing at a Pennsylvania rally on Sept. 28 and traveling to Cleveland to participate in a Sept. 29 debate alongside Biden. RELATED:President Donald Trump's Preexisting Conditions Put Him at Higher Risk of Severe COVID-19 In his book, Meadows writes that he \"didn't want to take any unnecessary risks, but I also didn't want to alarm the public if there was nothing to worry about — which according to the new, much more accurate test, there was not.\" Meadows adds that supporters at the Pennsylvania rally \"would never have known that anything was amiss.\" The day before the debate, Trump held a press conference in the Rose Garden with business leaders to discuss the administration's pandemic efforts. \"Somewhat ironically, considering his circumstances,\" Meadows writes, the president spoke about a new testing strategy that would \"give quicker, more accurate\" results. On debate day, Meadows writes that Trump looked slightly better, \"emphasis on the wordslightly.\" \"His face, for the most part at least, had regained its usual light bronze hue, and the gravel in his voice was gone,\" Meadows writes in his book, according to theGuardian. \"But the dark circles under his eyes had deepened. As we walked into the venue around five o'clock in the evening, I could tell that he was moving more slowly than usual. He walked like he was carrying a little extra weight on his back.\" Trump's family members, including the first lady and his four adult children, wore masks to the debate venue but did not wear them during or afterwards. RELATED:Donald Trump Leaves Walter Reed After Being Hospitalized for Coronavirus A few days after that, on Oct. 2, Trump announced that he and First LadyMelania Trumpboth hadcases of COVID-19. The president thenheaded to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. After Trump's COVID diagnosis was revealed, debate moderatorChris Wallacesaid Trump had arrived at the debate venue too late to be tested immediately prior, but that he and Biden were both bound by an \"honor system\" to make sure they were healthy and not going to pose a risk to each other or anyone else in the debate hall.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

On Wednesday, organizers behind the annual awards show — which celebrates the best of Broadway — announced that the upcoming show would be postponed in the wake ofthe coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Originally scheduled to air live on June 7 from Radio City Music Hall in New York City, the decision to reschedule the Tonys was made by the show presenters The American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League, in coordination with broadcast partner CBS. “The health and safety of the Broadway community, artists and fans is of the utmost importance to us,” a representative for the show said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE. “We are looking forward to celebrating Broadway and our industry when it is safe to do so.” “We will announce new dates and additional information once Broadway opens again,” the statement said. RELATED: A Running List of Every Festival, Sporting Event and Show Canceled or Postponed in the Wake of the Coronavirus Broadway has been dark since March 12, with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Broadway League President Charlotte St. Martin bringing the curtain down on all performances in order to help stop the spread of the global pandemic. The shutdown — the longest in Broadway history — was expected to be over April 12, with the Broadway League originally setting the week of April 13 as the date when performances would resume. No new date has been announced yet. Since performance stopped on Broadway, several shows that would have been in the running for Tony nominations have announced that they have closed permanently — including playsThe Inheritance,Hangmen, and the revival ofWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolfstarring Laurie Metcalf and Rupert Everett. Other shows — like the Broadway revival ofCaroline, or Change, new playsBirthday Candles(with Debra Messing) andIntimate Apparel, and the new musicalFlying Over Sunset —have been moved to the fall.

Ted was the younger brother of former PresidentJohn F. Kennedyand U.S. Attorney General and Sen.Robert F. Kennedy. According to a2009 ABC News profile, Kennedy first met Ted when she worked as a summer intern in his Senate office. Years later, they caught up at her parents' 1991 anniversary party (at the time, she was a divorced mother of two with a career as an attorney). She spoke of their courtship as \"old-fashioned\" and \"slow-paced\" in a 1992 interview with Boston TV station WCVB, saying \"He'd come over for dinner and kind of hang out and help the children with their homework … and it a gradual deepening of a family friendship into something that was a lot more.\" Following their marriage, Kennedy became Ted's most trusted political advisor, with late American journalistCokie Robertsonce saying \"It would not surprise me if she decided to run for the Senate. She knows politics. She knows substance. It's normal for someone who's been that involved to want to stay involved.\" Ted Kennedy died on August 25, 2009, of a malignant brain tumor at his home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: ForKimberly Mata-Rubio, the Texas gubernatorial election was personal. Her daughter Alexandria Aniyah Rubio –\"Lexi\"— was just 10 years old when she was shot to death by a teenager whowalked into her Uvalde, Texas, elementary schoolin May and went on a 90-minute rampage.Nineteen children and two teacherswere killed. Mata-Rubio, a local journalist, mother of six, who's married to a sheriff's deputy, had tried her best to gather support for DemocratBeto O'Rourke's gubernatorial campaign, believing he would at last enact sensible gun laws in the state. Finding out that Republican Gov.Greg Abbott— who had signed into law permitless carry and other loose gun measures — won reelection not only in state vote totals,but in Uvalde County, was crushing. \"I wanted to send a message but, instead, the state of Texas sent me a message: my daughter's murder wasn't enough,\"she tweeted Tuesday night. \"Just know, you f----- with the wrong mom. It doesn't end tonight. I'll fight until I have nothing left to give. Lexi's legacy will be change.\" The gunman was a loner who had legally purchased two AR-15-style rifles and ammo immediately after turning 18, the week before the mass killing. Grieving parents wanted answers about the bungled police response and what the state could do to stop future school shootings. Abbott's challenger, Beto O'Rourke famouslyinterrupted the governor's press conferencethe day after the shooting, telling the Republican governor, \"you are doing nothing.\" O'Rourke also promised the families in Uvalde that if elected governor, he'd act on guns, and made the issue central to his campaign. Just before the sole political debate between Abbott and O'Rourke,Mata-Rubio spoke for families of Robb Elementary School victims, giving their full support to O'Rourke. \"I'm speaking directly to moms when I say our babies' lives are on the ballot,\" she said. \"It happened to me, it can happen to you. And this pain, it'll bring you to your knees.\" The groupfelt let down by Abbottwhen he failed to raise the minimum age for buying an assault rifle from 18 to 21 after meeting with them. Instead, he continuedpointing the finger at a mental healthcrisis — though the shooter, who died by the hands of police, had no diagnosed mental health issues. The May 24 massacre was the deadliest school shooting in the state's history. PresidentJoe Bidengave a speechat the White House, beseeching, \"As a nation we have to ask, when in God's name are we going to stand up to the gun lobby?\" He visited more than once to console grieving families. Seated next to her husband, Mata-Rubio testified before the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform on June 8th,pleading for stricter gun laws. \"Somewhere out there, a mom is hearing our testimony and thinking to herself, 'I can't even imagine their pain,' not knowing that our reality will one day be hers, unless we act now.\" Thefirst major federal gun legislationin decades was passed June 25th to expand background checks for purchasers between age 18 and 21, and other reforms. Mata-Rubio also met former PresidentBill Clintonin Laredo days ago, before election results confirmed Abbott would stay in office. \"He encouraged us to keep fighting for change. We assured him we will never stop fighting. We also asked him to thank Hillary for the letter she sent Lexi,\"she wrote on Twitter. For this mom, five months have passed and the pain is still raw. Rubio's Facebook post on Halloween: \"We don't want to do this without you. None of it. Not Halloween, not Christmas, not birthdays, not Mondays, not Fridays, not life.

I'm not quite too sure where we go from here. I've done it all, this is it.\" \"I never feel that I'm an attractive, sexy person,\" David Beckhamdemurred in his cover interview. As if! The retired soccer star and father of four (oldest Brooklyn joked that it should've been him as SMA, not Dad) said his equally famous wife Victoria seemingly did agree with the title, though. \"I would hope that she feels this way about me all the time anyway!\" he said with a shy smile. \"But she said, 'Congratulations!' \" Let's be honest: You didn't even have to read Chris Hemsworth's cover story to know he was the perfect pick for Sexiest Man Alive. Not that the interviewwasn't great, especially when he joked that the \"bragging rights\" would mean he wouldn't have to do the dishes or \"change nappies\" for a few weeks (we bet wife Elsa Pataky disagrees). Also, wemade him read a vacuum manual– and thanks to that Aussie accent, it was amazing. Before hegot married,andstarred in his first feature film,Adam Levinewas named PEOPLE's Sexiest Man Alive – an honor he took with a grain of salt. \"You feel like you owe it to be kind of self-deprecating about it because it is an iconic thing, but also silly,\"he said. \"It's going to hit me when I'm constantly the butt of every joke every friend and family member makes for the next 20 years of my life, but I'm ready to handle it.\" It was a big year forChanning Tatum: He made ladies swoon inMagic Mike,The Vowand21 Jump Street, and waspreparing for fatherhood, too. So when he got the call from PEOPLE, \"My first thought was, 'Y'all are messing with me,'\"he said. His wife thought the same; after he told her, as they were bathing their dogs, \"She was like, 'What?'\" he recalled.

I'm a pirate, after all!\" Bennifer mania –Ben Affleck's romance withJennifer Lopez– was in full swing when the actor landed on the cover of PEOPLE's Sexiest Man Alive issue. Why all the hoopla? As friend director Kevin Smith told PEOPLE, \"Chicks gravitate to him. The word on the street is that he's the ideal man, chatty, gorgeous, generous and intelligent.\" Bond, James Bond, was the Sexiest Man Alive in 2001, with Pierce Brosnan on the cover. But offscreen, the sexy Dubliner had just one thing on his mind – his family. Said costar Julianna Margulies: \"When you see a gorgeous man holding hands with his wife and holding his baby, there's nothing more sexy in the world.\" The man of the millennium was none other thanBrad Pitt, who earned his second Sexiest Man Alive cover. Then, he was a newlywed, devoted to wifeJennifer Aniston. \"It was obvious they were madly in love,\" a crew member from Pitt's film,Snatch,told PEOPLE. Richard Gere was 50 when he was honored with the Sexiest Man Alive mantle in 1999 – and his ex-girlfriends were more than happy to come out of the woodwork to crow about why he's so hot. Said designer Diane Von Furstenberg, \"He walked like a biker, and that attracted me. I knew I was going to get my hands on him. I seduced him.\" He's played a sexy space hero (in theStar Warsfranchise) and sexy action heroes (Indiana Jones,anyone?), but Harrison Ford didn't think he was all that when he was named the Sexiest Man Alive in 1998. \"Why this sudden outpouring for geezers?\" Ford, then 56, asked PEOPLE. \"I never feel sexy. I have a distant relationship with the mirror.\" In his first Sexiest Man Alive cover,George Clooney's pals gushed about not only his looks, but also about his loyalty. \"The rap on George is that he's this rake, this guy's guy,\" hisERcostar Laura Innes told PEOPLE. \"That's true, but he is also a dear, loyal friend who would do anything for you. It's almost like being a family member.\" \"I don't take myself too seriously,\" PEOPLE's 1996 Sexiest Man Alive,Denzel Washington, admitted. \"I don't stop in the mirror and go, 'Hey, Sexy Man.'\" Maybe because he's not just another pretty face: AsCourage Under Firecostar Regina Taylor said, \"He has wit, style and intelligence.\" Following the one-two punch ofLegends of the FallandInterview with the Vampire,Brad Pittgraced the cover of  the 1995 issue. What was his appeal? As Nilo Otero, the assistant director onLegends,put it, the actor handled both women and wild horses in the film, making Pitt \"a man's man who seems to be a woman's man too.'' PEOPLE didn't name a Sexiest Man Alive in 1994 – or in 1993. Instead, Cindy Crawford and Richard Gere landed on the cover as the SexiestCoupleAlive. In spite of their careers as supermodel and superstar, the twosome (who split a year later) were a laid-back duo. \"Richard loves me without my makeup and in my ponytail,'' Crawford had said. ''So, hey, if it's good enough for him, it's good enough for me.'' The rugged star ofLorenzo's OilandThe Prince of Tideslanded on the cover of 1992's Sexiest Man Alive because of his bad-boy appeal, then described as a \"big-lug Adonis with the heart of gold.\" Thanks toGhost,Patrick Swayze went from bad boy dancer (inDirty Dancing) to Hollywood leading man. As his costar, Demi Moore, said, \"He has a very sweet, gentle, kind heart, and those southern manners. But he's also got a very rugged, animalistic physique.\" Thanks to a string of hits likeTop Gun, Risky Business, Rain Man, CocktailandAll the Right Moves,Tom Cruisewas box-office gold – and the Sexiest Man Alive. But it wasn't his smile, or his well-toned chest, thatRain Mancostar Valeria Golino said was his biggest asset. It was \"his eyes. Not their color. His regard – the way he looks with them. They're very alive.\" Who said younger is better? In 1989, when he was almost 60, Sean Connery was named the Sexiest Man Alive. His reaction? \"For once, I'm speechless. It'll all be downhill from here!'' One of New York's most eligible bachelors, John F. Kennedy Jr. had a reputation for being a bit of a party boy when the law student, then 27, was honored as the Sexiest Man Alive. But according to model Audra Avizienis, who had dated the President's son, \"He has this quiet sadness. There's something pensive and sad about him.\" Tragedy struck again almost 11 years later when Kennedy, his wife Carolyn and his sister-in-law Lauren died in a plane crash near Martha's Vineyard. Before he was aDancing with the Starshoofer, Harry Hamlin was a hot-shot attorney on the '80s dramaL.A. Law– and a very modest Sexiest Man Alive. \"Certainly when I look in the mirror, I don't get turned on,'' he told PEOPLE. ''It's not something I spend a lot of time considering.\" Thanks to two megahit shows –St. ElsewhereandMoonlighting– Mark Harmon was a true '80s It boy. Still, the second-ever Sexiest Man Alive didn't get the appeal. \"All I see is a bunch of fake teeth and football scars,\" he said. Before the scandals, there was the sexy: In 1985, Mel Gibson was the inaugural Sexiest Man Alive, thanks to his rough good looks in the post-apocalypticMad Maxflicks. But Gibson was uneasy with his growing celebrity, saying at the time, \"It's all happening too fast.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

KTLA executives were criticized for how they handled Romero's exit, including the decision to have entertainment reporter Sam Rubin break the news during a 40-second segment. The network's spokesperson Gary Weitman previously said Romero suddenly asked to go on vacation during the final week of her contract and could have said goodbye on the air, according to theTimes.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The scandal surroundingJohn Edwards— the two-time presidential candidate who stood trial on charges that he misused campaign funds to hide his pregnant mistress — was one of the biggest American political dramas in decades. But for then-101-year-old heiressRachel (“Bunny”) Lambert Mellon, who provided the bulk of the funds in question but was unaware of how Edwards was using the money, it was a grand old time. “He would have been a great president,” Mellon told author Meryl Gordon before her death in 2014, according toBunny Mellon: The Life of an American Style Legend, which hits bookstores Tuesday and delves into Mellon’s quietly stylish, American aristocrat lifestyle. “He and I were great friends. Every time he’d go on a debate against Hillary [Clinton], he’d call and we’d talk.'” According to Gordon, the heiress saw similarities between Edwards andJohn F. Kennedy. (She would know. Mellon was friends withthe Kennedysand redesigned the White House Rose Garden at JFK’s request.) “[Edwards] was wise, he was clear, he was a very good person,” she told Gordon. “I don’t like complicated people.” But Mellon did, evidently, relish a complicated game. After meeting the charming North Carolina senator, Mellon — whose grandfather invented Listerine and whose second husband was banking heir Paul Mellon — wanted to contribute to Edwards’ 2008 presidential campaign. “Bunny defiantly believed that John Edwards could do no wrong. Imbued by a sense of patriotism and a desire to be relevant, she saw this campaign as a chance to elect a liberal Democrat to the White House,” writes Gordon. “This wasn’t a shallow thing with a handsome man,” Tony Willis, Mellon’s librarian, told the author. “‘She really took it seriously and wanted to help the country.” At first, Mellon started with standard contributions: $3 million to two of his entities, asked her attorneys to host two fundraisers for Edwards in New York City, and even wrote and paid for an ad supporting his campaign in her local newspaper, according to the biography.Her contributions became less traditional after she read about the criticism he received for $400 haircuts charged to his campaign. “I was sitting alone in a grim mood — furious that the press attacked Senator Edwards on the price of a haircut,” Mellonwrote to Edwards’ campaign aide Andrew Young,“But it inspired me — from now on, all haircuts, etc., that are necessary and important for his campaign — please send the bills to me.” When her lawyers informed her that she wasn’t legally allowed to underwrite Edwards’ personal expenses, the elderly heiress devised a scheme to fund him through an intermediary.According toForbes, she sent checks to her friend and interior decorator Bryan Huffman under the guise that she was buying antiques (‘chairs’, ‘bookcase’, and ‘antique Charleston table’). Huffman then sent along the money to the Edwards camp. Neither Mellon nor Huffman knew exactly how the money was being used. “Later in life, Bunny loved to play games, she loved fairy tales and horoscopes and wishes,” her lawyer, Alex D. Forger, told Gordon. “Games appealed to her. There was this intrigue. She didn’t want me to know she was giving to John Edwards, maybe I would disapprove. I kept asking, ‘Where is the money going?’ ” The note she wrote Andrew Young would later be used as evidence that the $725,000 she gave him was a campaign contribution, and not a gift as Forger argued in court. Mellon was never accused of any wrongdoing. RELATED VIDEO: Friends of JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette Kennedy on Their Bond Edwards was eventuallyacquitted on one charge,while the five other charges of conspiracy and campaign fraud were dropped because the jury couldn’t reach a verdict,according toThe New York Times. That did little to quell the scathing criticism he received for having an affair withRielle Hunterwhile his wife was fighting stage-four breast cancer (Elizabeth Edwards died in 2010), using funds from Mellon to hide Hunter and her pregnancy during the campaign, and later denying that he was thefather of Hunter’s daughter. “I did an awful, awful lot that was wrong,” Edwards said after the verdict,per theTimes. “I am responsible. I don’t have to go any further than the mirror. It’s me and me alone.” But through it all, one of his few remaining supporters was Bunny Mellon — although she said she wished he had paid for his mistress himself. “He’s a very, very nice guy,'” Mellon told Chris Matthews, according to the book. “What went wrong with him? I mean, I just sort of feel someone came and put an injection in him and made him a little naughty. Even now, I’m for John Edwards.” Gordon writes that Mellon got a kick out of being part of the investigation, and even befriended Chuck Stuber, the FBI agent who interviewed her. (Stuber told the author that Mellon “had an interesting take on mistresses. It was like — ‘everybody does this.’ ” Still, Stuber said Mellon told him she “didn’t want her money going to support John Edwards’s mistress.”) While she no longer gave Edwards money (he reportedly asked for help to pay for his trial expenses), they did talk on the phone occasionally. Mellon even insisted that Edwards be a pallbearer at her funeral, although her family forbade it after shepassed away on March 17, 2014, at the age of 103. Whatever her family’s opinion of Edwards, Mellon loved supporting the man she hoped would be president. “When she talked it over from time to time with Bryan Huffman,” Gordon writes, “she would often end with the same wistful line: ‘Didn’t we have fun?’ ” Bunny Mellon: The Life of an American Style Iconis on sale now.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Besides being a great space to make faces in the mirror in private, it’s also known for its six-story lobby, 2,200-seat auditorium and Hollywood glam décor. The ballroom, where she shows off a few of her moves, can accommodate 2,000, if you want to host a dance party of your own. Millennium Biltmore Hotel, 506 South Grand Avenue Swift is first seen looking somber in front of a sea of photographers at this historic hotspot (rooms start at around $224). She strolled through the 1923 landmark’s halls, which feature carved columns, crystal chandeliers and embroidered tapestries.

President Teddy Roosevelt actually purchased the establishment in 1905, and it was reopened again in 2004. The website describes it as an “everyday watering hole” for downtown residents, and with $8 cocktails and $5 beers, its dress code is certainly relaxed enough for dark jeans and Nikes.

Democratic lawmakers immediately slammed the proposal as inadequate. “CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus,” Trumpwrote on Twitteron Tuesday. On Wednesday morning, he blamed media outlets for exacerbating undue alarm about the virus’ spread, which led to fluctuating financial markets. That included a historic two-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. “This is a time of peak uncertainty for coronavirus,” one investortoldThe Wall Street Journal. “We don’t yet know the size of how much it’s spread or the mortality rate. That’s what markets are reacting to, peak uncertainty, rather than facts.” Trump, 73,tweetedthat he plans a news conference on Wednesday night from the White House with the CDC. RELATED:What to Know About the Mysterious Coronavirus Spreading in Asia — and How to Protect Yourself So far, some 81,000 cases have been reported worldwide of the coronavirus. Of those cases, about 2,700 people have died (By comparison, the Ebola epidemic that began in West Africa in 2014 infected about 28,600 people and killed about 11,300,according to the CDC.) The infection is thought to have originated in a Chinese animal market in December. MSNBC and CNN “are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible,” the presidenttweetedon Wednesday, misspelling the name of the disease. “USA in great shape!” he added, tagging the CDC. “This virus won’t last forever. We have contained it,” Trump’s economic adviser, Larry Kudlow,said Tuesday. That same day, however, the CDC’s Dr. Nancy Messonnier told reporters that health officials had become more concerned about the virus’ rapid rate of infection. “The spread in other countries has raised our level of concern and raised our level of expectation that we are going to have community spread here,” said Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC. “We’re asking folks in every sector as well as people within their families to start planning for this, because as we’ve seen from the recent countries that have had community spread, when it’s hit in those countries it has moved quite rapidly so we want to make sure that the American public is prepared.” “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country anymore but a question of when this will happen,” she said. RELATED:San Francisco Declares State of Emergency Amid Coronavirus Outbreak The American public “need[s] to prepare for a significant disruption” to their lives and plan for possible school closures, find out about teleworking options and if their health care providers offer telemedicine options, Messonnier said. “We are asking the American public to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad,” she said. The sudden urgency after weeks of emphasizing that the risk to the average American is “low” comes from the abrupt spread of the new coronavirus, officially termed COVID-19, in countries outside of China. Over the weekend, cases of coronavirus soared in Italy (283 cases and seven deaths), South Korea (977 cases and 10 deaths) and Iran (95 cases and 16 deaths). Austria and Croatia also said they’ve seen their first cases. Currently, the U.S. has57 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Forty of those are passengers aboard a cruise ship in Japan, and three others were repatriated from China. Messonnier told reporters on Tuesday that the CDC is unsure if the U.S. will have as dramatic of a spread as China, Italy and South Korea. “What we still don’t know is what that will look like. We can have community spread in the United States and have it be relatively mild and we can have community spread in the U.S. and have it be very severe, so that is what we don’t completely know yet, and we of course don’t completely know when it’s going to happen,” she said. The hope, Messonnier said, is that the U.S. will be “overprepared.” That same day, on Twitter, Trumpgroused aboutwhat he viewed as unfavorable coverage of his administration’s work. “No matter how well we do, however, the Democrats talking point is that we are doing badly. If the virus disappeared tomorrow, they would say we did a really poor, and even incompetent, job. Not fair, but it is what it is,” he wrote. “So far, by the way, we have not had one death. Let’s keep it that way!” But critics have said that, so far, the approach has been “too little too late,” contrasting the approach with that of PresidentBarack Obamaduring the Ebola outbreak in 2014 — which Trump heavily criticized at the time. RELATED:Here’s a Map of the Coronavirus Cases in the U.S. On Monday, the White House asked Congress for $1.25 billion in new funding and said it wants to move another $1.25 billion from existing funding, for a total of $2.5 billion to respond to the coronavirus, the Associated Press reported. Among the existing money the administration wants to re-allocate are funds to handle Ebola. “Despite urgent warnings from Congress and the public health community, the Trump administration took weeks to request these emergency funds,” Rep. Nita Lowey, the House Appropriations Committee chairwoman, said in a statement, according to the AP. “Their answer now is to raid money Congress has designated for other critical public health priorities.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called it “too little too late,”according toThe New York Times.

On Wednesday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelositold CNN, “I don’t think the president knows what he’s talking about — once again.” But, theTimesreported, “a senior administration official on Monday dismissed Democratic concerns that the White House was unprepared. Global health is still being monitored; responsibility has simply been moved to the National Security Council’s programs to counter the proliferation of nuclear weapons and defend against biological attacks, the official said.” “We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries,” Trumptweetedon Monday. “CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart.

The former president, 76, sat with reporters for an interview aboard his private plane on Monday night, according to Fox News Digital. During the conversation, hecalled McConnell a \"lousy leader\"and Scott \"highly underrated,\" according to The Hill. Scott is believed to be quietly mulling a presidential run against Trump in 2024. Republicans will elect a new GOP Senate leader to a two-year term in January — regardless of Tuesday's election results — and often the party's top-ranking official is a shoo-in for the position. In this case, that's Senate Minority Leader McConnell. But if enough Republicans are dissatisfied with their leadership, they can nominate someone in his place. If Scott — or another senator — has enough support, they could take the job away from McConnell, which is likely what Trump is pushing for when publicly endorsing Scott. McConnell is the longest-serving Senate Republican leader in U.S. history, holding the title since 2007. During his tenure, he has switched between Senate majority leader and minority leader, based on which party controls the upper chamber of Congress. In the same interview, Trump — who has openly teased a forthcoming announcement about his 2024 presidential aspirations — dissuaded other possible Republican candidates from running against him, saying \"it would be good for the party,\" according to Fox. The statement appeared to target Florida Gov.Ron DeSantis, who polls say is the most likely Republican to give Trump a challenge in a hypothetical presidential primary.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Sen.Raphael Warnockgrew up in Savannah, Georgia, the 11th of 12 children born to pastor parents. He long ago followed them into the pulpit — he's been the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta since 2005 — but recently has forged his own path in politics, winning a special election in 2020 to serve in the U.S. Senate, a seat to which he was re-elected in 2022. Now he adds children's book author to his résumé withPut Your Shoes On & Get Ready!In the picture book, illustrated by TeMika Grooms and published Jan.10, Warnock recalls the advice his father always doled out — even when waking up sleepy kids on Saturday mornings. \"You didn't sleep late in my house,\" Warnock told PEOPLE. \"He had a fierce work ethic.\" Warnock, who is the father of two children of his own, talked with PEOPLE about the process of writing his new book and the lessons his parents taught him about race, resilience, and hope for a better future. This is a lovely book about your childhood and your family and your growing up. What made you decide to write this book for kids? The book is about both preparation and purpose. It's about getting yourself ready for what life sends your way. And it's an affirmation of my belief that there's a place for each of us in the world. Part of life is finding the shoes that fit our feet, so we can get going. It's inspired by my dad, who woke me up every morning with the same message: \"Get up. Get dressed. Put your shoes on.\" That's a mantra I've taken through life: that you have to show up and be ready, and that it's important to be yourself. Put on your shoes, and the shoes that fit your feet. That sense of purpose, the recognition that we all have gifts and something to offer to the world, is something that I want to share with every child. And I'm inspired to do it in this children's book, both as a pastor and a senator, but also as a dad. There's a page in the book that I think is really important, in which your parents are telling you about what it was like growing up Black during segregation. What did you take away from those conversations when you were a kid? It gave me a sense of identity, and it helped me to understand the world that my father knew as a young person. So it was a part of my awakening and consciousness about what it means to navigate the world as a Black person, as a person of color. But I think what I'm struck by is that my dad was never bitter. He was still resilient and hopeful, while at the same time, very clear-eyed about the complex reality of our country along racial lines. My dad was born in 1917. So by the time I came along, he had already lived through the Civil Rights movement. He had already endured the absurdity of Jim Crow segregation, as exemplified in that one episode that I lay out in the book, where here he is a World War II veteran, wearing his soldier's uniform and asked to give up his seat for a young white teenager. The skin he was wearing was more consequential, and important for some, than the uniform he was wearing. So that is just one of those family stories that ground you in the reality of who you are and the work that we must continue to do. But my dad also lived to seeBarack Obamabecome president. I went to the inauguration. I remember talking to him on the phone while he was at home in Savannah, and I was standing there in the freezing cold watching the first Black man be inaugurated as President of the United States. And I could hear and feel the pride over the phone, and that's part of my story and the American story. What do you tell your own kids when you talk about the world as it is, the world as you might hope it to be? It's something I'm navigating right now as a dad, because, let's face it: as a parent, you want your children to enjoy the beauty and the magic and the innocence of childhood. My daughter is six and my son is four. And I'm navigating right now, how do you explain certain things? But I think the care that you have as a parent is what comes through in the way I tell that story in the book. And so, if you don't mind, one last question that's political. After midterms, which have left us with a Democratic-led Senate and Republican-led House, with all these standoffs looming, do you still have hope that Congress can get to work and get things done? Yes, I do remain hopeful. I'm very clear about the political reality. But I came to Congress in a 50/50 Senate, and I think that when the history of the 117th Congress was written, it will be clear that this is one of the most productive congresses in modern history. We got major bipartisan legislation passed on everything from investing in industrial manufacturing, to historic investments in veterans benefits, to the inflation — well, the Inflation Reduction Act, that was [just Democrats]. But a very, very productive Congress over bipartisan infrastructure. Never miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletterto stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. That's certainly been my goal. I'm the 18th most bipartisan senator in the Senate. I think that's quite an achievement when you think about the fact that I was number 100 last Congress in terms of seniority, and everybody knew I was up for re-election. And yet, I was able to convince enough of my Republican colleagues to work with me that I'm ranked as one of the most bipartisan senators in the Senate, working with Republicans on everything from maternal healthcare to helping farmers to overcome red tape and get their products to European markets. So with a six-year term, I remain hopeful that I can continue to do a lot of bipartisan work. And I think when you center the people, rather than the politics, you can get almost anything done.

She was spotted sitting near President Moon- Jae-in in the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium Sunday. Vice President Mike Pence attended the Olympics opening ceremony, which did not sit well with the Winter Games’ first two openly gay U.S. athletes: Adam Rippon and Gus Kenworthy. Rippon, a breakout star of the Games who is taking home a bronze medal as part of the figure skating team event, had said he did not want to meet with the vice president during the competition, due to the politician’s record on LGBT rights. Pence later tweeted his interest in meeting Rippon, while the athlete said he’s potentially open to a meeting with the politicianafterthe Games. Kenworthy, meanwhile, broke his thumb during the Games and joked that one upside to the injury is thathe’ll be unable to shake Pence’s hand.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Counties with higher populations of black residents accounted for 58 percent of the COVID-19 deaths nationwide Black Americans are disproportionally getting infected with — and dying from — the new coronavirus, COVID-19,a new study found. Using demographic data, researchers found that counties with higher populations of black residents accounted for 58 percent of the COVID-19 deaths nationwide. “Roughly one in five counties nationally is disproportionately black and only represent 35 percent of the U.S. population, but we found that these counties accounted for nearly half of COVID-19 cases and 58 percent of COVID-19 deaths,” the researchers, from four universities in conjunction with the nonprofit AIDS research organization amFar and PATH’s Center for Vaccine Innovation and Access, said in the study. While the discrepancy has beenanecdotally noted by mayors like Chicago’s Lori Lightfootand several senators based on local statistics, this is one of the first large studies to look at the issue nationwide. RELATED:NAACP President Derrick Johnson Says ‘Stay Safe’ as Michigan Releases Racial Breakdown of Coronavirus Cases The study has not yet been published in a journal, but the scientists wanted to push out the information to help lawmakers better understand the need for more support in these communities. The research also echoes data from several states and cities, such as Chicago,WisconsinandLouisiana. “In small metro areas as well as rural areas, we're seeing disproportionately higher COVID-19 deaths taking place in primarily black counties,” Gregorio Millett, a lead investigator on the study and amFar vice president,told Politico. The study also found that the people living in these areas were more likely to have underlying conditions that can cause severe cases of COVID-19, such as hypertension, heart disease and diabetes. They were also less likely to have access to consistent medical care, and more likely to have jobs considered “essential” that require them to work during the pandemic, such as nurses, grocery store clerks and bus drivers. “We know that being uninsured and crowded living conditions are associated with increases in COVID-19 diagnoses among black Americans,” Millett said. RELATED:Will Smith Interviews Dr. Anthony Fauci About the Prevalence of COVID-19 in African Americans Black people in the U.K. are similarly affected by COVID-19.

And those of Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Indian and mixed ethnicities also had a \"statistically significant raised risk of death,” according to the report, from the U.K.’s Office of National Statistics,CNN reported. The higher rates of death are \"partly a result of socio-economic disadvantage and other circumstances, but a remaining part of the difference has not yet been explained,\" the study said. Legislators in both countries are pushing for greater support and medical care for black communities.

Erin Burnett reports that a source told her Trump “berated Hicks after her testimony to Congress yesterday.” “According to the source, Trump asked Hicks after the testimony how could she be so stupid, and apparently that was the final straw for Hope Hicks,” said the journalist, who anchorsErin Burnett OutFront. A day later, Wednesday,a rattled Hicks resigned. “Hicks was cryingas news of her impending departure rippled through Washington and beyond,” one senior official said, according to theWashington Post. The White House has denied that Trump berated Hicks, according to CNN. Hicks, one of Trump’s most loyal aideswhom staffers reportedly refer to as Trump’s “real daughter,” said in a statement announcing her departure that “there are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump.” A source tells PEOPLE thatHicks felt “it was time to resign.” “She has been incredibly loyal to him for a long time but it’s been a tough few years and she had enough. She needed to make a change after everything she has been through,” says the source. The 29-year-old’s resignation comes after she reportedly declined to answer most of the questions posed to her during the eight-hour, closed door meeting with the House Intelligence Committee — but did admit thatshe had told white lies for the president, according toThe New York Times. Trump wasn’t the only one buzzing about Hicks reportedly fudging the truth at times for Trump. OnThe ViewThursday morning, co-host Joy Behar asked Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee that heard Hicks’s testimony, “Can little white lies lead to little white perjury?” The California congressman replied, “If a witness is willing to say things that aren’t true outside the committee on behalf of the boss, we need to know because it reflects whether she’ll be truthful in the committee.” Schiff said he wants Hicks subpoenaed, forcing her to answer questions or be held in contempt of Congress. “The most significant issue I had with her testimony were the whole areas [where] she refused to testify on the instructions of the White House. She can’t [refuse] unless we let her do that … We have very important questions to ask of Hope Hicks about the preparation of that false statement about the meeting at Trump Tower with the Russians.” Schiff is referring to Hicks’s involvement with the crafting of a statement with Donald Trump about ameeting during the summer of 2016 between Russians, Donald Trump Jr. and other Trump campaign aidesat Trump Tower.

Speaking to a crowd of supporters Tuesday night at a Pennsylvania re-election rally for PresidentDonald Trump, in an exceedingly rare campaign appearance, the first lady accused Democratic lawmakers of being poor political role models for kids — an oblique deflection of criticism about her husband's own rhetoric and leadership. \"Children watching and learning about politics in our country deserved a better display of political responsibility and respect for our sacred institutions,\" Mrs. Trump, 50, said while calling the president's impeachment last December over his Ukraine scandal a \"sham.\" The first lady's speech was her first official campaign event of the 2020 race and came one week before Election Day, when voters will have their final say between Trump, 74, or former Vice PresidentJoe Biden, 77. \"Donald is a fighter,\" the first lady said Tuesday. \"He loves this country and he fights for you every single day.\" Mrs. Trump previously delivered remarks during theRepublican National Convention in Augustand had a prior campaign appearance canceled in Marchamid the novel coronavirus pandemicthat ultimately infected the first family. Mrs. Trump's speech Tuesday focused largely on the coronavirus — along with a wry reference to the president's inflammatory Twitter habits — and saw the first lady cast the Trumps as empathetic toward coronavirus victims after having themselves fallen ill with the respiratory illness earlier this month. \"Like many of you, I have experienced the firsthand effects of COVID-19, not only as a patient, but as a worried mother and wife,\" Mrs. Trump said. \"I know there are many people who have lost loved ones or know people who have been forever impacted by this silent enemy.\" RELATED:Kamala Harris & Husband Doug Emhoff Open Up About a Pandemic Campaign, Private Time Together and the Future The first lady, the president and their teenage son,Barron, have all contracted the virus in recent weeks and since recovered.

Armed with twist ties, rope, tape and the hammer reportedly used to break through the home's sliding glass door, a suspect — whomauthorities later identified as David DePape— allegedly tried restraining the House speaker's husband, Paul Pelosi, so that they could wait for Nancy to return. However,Paul escapedto the bathroom with a phone to dial 911. In an interview on CNN'sAnderson Cooper360that aired Monday, Nancy, 82, revealed how she found out about the incident. \"I was sleeping in Washington, D.C. I had just gotten in the night before from San Francisco,\" Nancy told host Anderson Cooper in her first sit-down interview since the attack. Taking a pause, she then shared, \"And the — I hear the doorbell ring, and it's 5-something... [I think] it must be the wrong apartment. It rings again, and then bang, bang, bang, bang on the door. So I run to the door. And I'm very [scared].\" She said she saw Capitol Police outside of her door, and they told her they needed to speak with her. \"I'm thinking my children, my grandchildren,\" she said. \"I never thought it would be Paul because I knew he wouldn't be out and about.\" She continued, \"They came in, at that time we didn't even know where he was or what his condition was. We just knew there was an assault on him in our home, and now they were taking him to a hospital, which turned out to be [Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital]. ... It wasn't the closest but it was the right place to go for that.\" She was later told that the assailant hit Paul, 82, in the head twice with the hammer. \"That's pretty awful,\" she said. As Nancy rushed to the hospital to see him, Paul was already out of surgery. According to her son Paul Pelosi, Jr., her husband said, \"Oh, your mother's going to be very happy because the Ravens won last night.\" \"[We have a] Baltimore connection,\" Nancy said, adding that her husband's comment reassured her that he would be okay. Police reported thatthe assailant said he planned on attacking Nancy; however, she was not home. \"For me, this is really the hard part because Paul was not the target, and he's the one who's paying the price,\" she told Cooper. \"It's really sad because it is a flame that was fueled by misinformation and all of the rest of that, which is most unfortunate and has no place in our democracy.\" Reacting to PresidentJoe Bidencomparingthe Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol— when rioters were searching for Nancy — to the attack inside of her home, Nancy said she \"absolutely\" believes there's a connection. \"There's no question. It's the same thing,\" she told Cooper. She added that after the Jan. 6 attack and the incident inside of her home, the country should look towards healing. Still, she addressed the reality that history could repeat itself. \"You would think that there would be some level of responsibility, but you see what the reaction is on the other side — to make a joke of it — and really that is traumatizing, too. But nonetheless, forgetting them, there has to be some healing process,\" she said. \"Democrats and Republicans, members of Congress, anybody can be a target.\" She explained, \"In our democracy, there is one party that is doubting the outcome of the election, feeding that flame and mocking any violence that happens. That has to stop.\" Nancy went on to address those like former PresidentDonald TrumpandElon Muskwho have \"[cast] doubt\" on attacks that have occurred. \"It's really sad for the country that people of that high visibility would separate themselves from the facts and the truth in such a blatant way. It's really sad, and it is traumatizing to those affected by it. They don't care about that obviously,\" Nancy said. \"But it's destructive to the unity that we want to have in our country.\" \"There has to be some adult supervision on the Republican side in order to say, 'Enough. Enough,' \" she added. After Nancy's interview aired,Trump appeared to address her commentsduring a Republican rally in Ohio, per multiple outlets. Calling her \"an animal,\" he added, \"They'll say, 'What a horrible thing he said about Nancy.' She impeached me twice for nothing.\" In her sit-down, Nancy concluded by thanking supporters for their prayers, which she described as \"unifying.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

In the aftermath of the 2005 hurricane — which made landfall in the U.S. three times — a reported 1,833 people died,according to theWashington Post. Trump also commented on the amount of financial help the U.S. territory seemed to require from the mainland government, saying, “I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you’ve thrown our budget a little out of whack, because we’ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, and that’s fine.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Less than a year after Donald Trump won the presidential election and was inaugurated as President of the United States, many people still struggle to come to grips with this unexpected reality. One of those people is Trump’s former opponent, Hillary Clinton, who recently wrote a book trying to make sense of what had happened to her and everyone else. One of the things Clinton describes at length inWhat Happenedis the strange experience of attending her victorious opponent’s presidential inauguration. She elaborated on it in a new interview onThe Graham Norton Show. First of all, Clinton says she didn’t even want to attend the ceremony. She went not as the losing candidate but as a former first lady, and even then, she told Norton, she and her husband Bill Clinton tried to see if there was a way out. “We thought maybe others aren’t going. So we called the Bushes,” Clinton said. “The elder Bushes were in the hospital, which I think was legitimate. So then we called the younger Bushes and they said, ‘Yeah, we’re going.’ Then we called the Carters and they said, ‘Yeah, we’re going.’ So Bill and I said, ‘Oh, we have to go.’ ” Despite the acrimony of her campaign battles against Trump, Clinton said she still had hopes for his inaugural speech —and soon found herself disappointed. “What I wanted to have happen was, despite the kind of campaign he ran, I wanted him to rise to the occasion of being our president, and being the president of everybody, not just people who supported him. That didn’t happen,” Clinton said. “So we were sitting there and we were listening, I was sitting next to George W. Bush and Bill was on my other side, and we were listening to this really dark, divisive speech that I describe as ‘a cry from the white nationalist gut.’ I was so disappointed and really so sad that it wasn’t an outreach, it was a narrowing and a hammering of what he said before.” Watch the full clip above.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was “feeling fine” after worry that he would test positive for the novel coronavirus after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, announced last week she was infected. Trudeau has said he was placing himself in a 14-day self-isolation alongside his wife and their three children at their Ottawa residence last Thursday. The announcement came after Mrs. Trudeau returned home with flu-like symptoms following a trip to Britain. She tested positive on Thursday. “I want to be clear: I have no symptoms and I am feeling very good,” the prime minister told reporters outside his residence on Friday,according to videoof his news conference. Trudeau, 48, said he hasn’t been tested for the virus, echoing PresidentDonald Trump‘s initial stance on being tested after Trump also came into contact with people who later tested positive for the virus. Over the weekend, the White House said Trump was tested and the results came back negative. “There is no need to get tested until you are starting to show symptoms,” TrudeaurepeatedTuesday during a press conference in front of his Ottawa residence, according to Huffington Post reporter Althia Raj. Dr. Anthony Fauci — the leading medical official on Trump’s coronavirus task force — said Americans shouldn’t get tested unless they have symptoms. However, medical professionalssaypeople who have the coronavirus can still spread the disease whether they show symptoms or not. There had been 424 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Canada as of Tuesday, with four deaths. Trudeau, one of the most prominent world leaders, is the latest on a growing list of government officials who have either contracted the virus or have been in contact with those who have. Government officials in France, Iran, Brazil, Australia, and Italy have tested positive for the new coronavirus, which first emerged in China in December.

Trump changed his tone on the viral outbreak this week, calling it “bad” after previously claiming Democrats were trying to politicize it as a “hoax” to damage him. “I think people have noticed that the situation has evolved rapidly around the world,” Trudeau told reporters Tuesday, calling on Canadians to “stay home” and use “as much social distancing as possible.” RELATED:Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau ‘Self-Isolating’ with Wife Sophie as She Has Coronavirus Test Late last week, an Australian official who had met with President Trump’s daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, tested positive for the coronavirus.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The results of Tuesday's race remain unclear though the map now tilts toward Biden — while President Donald Trump has falsely suggested the votes against him are fraudulent Democratic nomineeJoe Biden, emboldened by strong results in several swing states, on Wednesday afternoon urged patience and unity after abitterly fought electionthat he increasingly believed would soon make him the president. Speaking from Wilmington, Delaware, Biden also touched on incumbentDonald Trump's false claims about already having won the election, despite millions of votes remaining to be counted. And, repeating a familiar argument he has made all campaign, Biden, 77, cast himself as the antidote to such division. \"I will work as hard for those who didn’t vote for me as I will for those who did,\" he said. \"Now every vote must be counted. No one is going to take our democracy away from us. Not now. Not ever. America has come too far. America has fought too many battles. America has endured too much to let that happen.\" \"We the People' will not be silenced. 'We the People' will not be bullied. 'We the People” will not surrender,\" he continued. And, he said, \"I’m confident that we will emerge victorious.\" RELATED:See Up-to-the-Minute Results from the Race Between Biden and Trump The results of Tuesday's race remain unclear though the mapnow tilts toward Biden, whom The Associated Press has projected will win the key swing states of Arizona, Minnesota and Wisconsin, with additional (albeit narrow) leads in Michigan and Nevada. Trump, 74, won in Florida, Ohio and Texas and has thin leads in Georgia and North Carolina. He would hope to win Pennsylvania as well as come from behind in Michigan and Nevada — and he has been suggesting that any votes that are now being counted against him are fraudulent. More conclusive results were expected in the swing states on Wednesday night as well as Thursday, as the historic crush of ballots continue to be counted. Trump's campaign has said they will request a recount in Wisconsin, given the 21,000-vote margin favoring Biden — though past recounts (including in the 2016 presidential race) did not adjust the final tallies much. Separately, the campaign also said it would bring a lawsuit in Michigan, making good on Trump's threats to question ballot counting that did not favor him. Speaking Wednesday afternoon, however, Biden was confident his leads would hold, he said. \"Government of, by, and for the people is very much alive in the United States of America. ... Now, after a long night of counting, it is clear we are winning in enough states to reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency,\" he said. \"I am not here to declare that I have won. I am here to report that when the count is finished, I believe I will be the winner.\" Trump, who briefly spoke from the White House early Wednesday, had not yet made a public appearance or remarks later that day and reporters at the White House said he was not in the West Wing. He was tweeting though. In a string of social media posts he continued to claim victory over states where the results were not yet known — leading Twitter, not for the first time, to label his posts as possible misinformation. During his speech from the White House East Room around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, Trump quipped to laughter that \"this is without question the latest news conference I've ever had.\" From there, however, the president's humor evaporated as he ran down a familiar list of grievances and lies about the election, including falsely boasting of victory in various states and attacking voting itself. He repeated his attacks on lawfully cast ballots that are lawfully counted after Election Day, as has long happened in various states. And he said, at the end of a confused and rambling stretch, that his campaign might turn to the Supreme Court for relief. \"This is a fraud on the American public. This is an embarrassment to our country,\" he said. \"We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.\" \"This is a major fraud in our nation, so we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court,\" he continued. RELATED:What Voters Across America Are Saying About the 2020 Election Vice PresidentMike Pence, on stage with Trump, seemed to quickly clarify, softening the president's stance: \"While the votes continue to remain counted were going to remain vigilant ... we're going to protect the integrity of the vote.\" Speaking later Wednesday, Biden spoke in more conciliatory terms, seemingly bolstered by a win he could see on the horizon. \"So once this election is finalized and behind us it will be time for us to do what we have always done as Americans: to put the harsh rhetoric of the campaign behind us, to lower the temperature, to see each other again,\" he said. \"To listen to each other again. To hear each other again. To respect and care for one another again.\" He continued: \"I know this won’t be easy. I’m not naïve. Neither of us are. I know how deep and hard the opposing views are in our country on so many things. But I also know this as well: To make progress we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Kutcher, 39,testified in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committeeon modern day slavery Wednesday. He spoke alongside Elisa Massimino, president and chief executive of the New York-based nonprofit Human Rights First, both of whom shared horrors they’ve witnessed through work with their respective organizations. (Kutcher is the co-founder ofThorn, a non-profit organizationthat “drives technology innovation to fight the sexual exploitation of children,” according to their website.) Kutcher gave a 15-minute speech on modern day slavery, compelling Congress to act to end the horrors faced by women and children around the globe. “I’m here today to defend the right to pursue happiness. It’s a simple notion: ‘the right to pursue happiness,’ ” he said. “It’s bestowed upon all of us by our constitution. Every citizen of this country has the right to pursue it. And I believe that it is incumbent on us as citizens of this nation, as Americans, to bestow that right upon others, upon each other, and upon the rest of the world. But the right to pursue happiness for so many is stripped away — it’s raped, it’s abused, it’s taken by force, fraud, or coercion. It is sold for the momentary happiness of another.” Kutcher’s speech was a timely one as next week marks Shine a Light on Slavery Day. He also spoke of the criticism he’s gotten from others — or as he referred to them, “trolls,” — who tell him to “stick to [his] day job.” He rebutted these critiques by saying that his work with Thornishis day job. He then told a harrowing story about seeing a child, the same age ashis daughter, Wyatt(with wifeMila Kunis), who is just 2 years old, being raped by an adult man. “I’ve seen video content of a child that’s the same age as mine being raped by an American man who was a sex tourist in Cambodia, and this child was so conditioned by her environment that she thought she was engaging in play,” he said. “I’ve been on the other end of a phone call from my team, asking for my help because we had received a call from the Department of Homeland Security, telling us that a 7-year-old girl was being sexually abused and that content was being spread around the dark web and she had been being abused and they’d watched her for three years, and they could not find the perpetrator, asking us for help.” “We were the last line of defense—an actor and his foundation were the potential last line of defense. That’s my day job, and I’m sticking to it.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The company announced the fan-favorite ride would be getting a refresh based on the 2009 Disney animated filmThe Princess and the Frog, which features the company's first Black princess, Tiana, at both Disneyland in California and Magic Kingdom in Florida back in 2020. Now, Disney has finally shared more details including the ride's name, inspiration, and general release date at the ESSENCE festival in New Orleans. As announced today at the French Quarter's historic Preservation Hall, the log-flume ride Disney parks fans know as Splash Mountain will soon be called Tiana's Bayou Adventure. RELATED: Disney's Splash Mountain Will Be Reimagined With Princess and the Frog Theme: 'We Are Thrilled' Alongside Princess Tiana, Naveen and jazz-loving alligator Louis, guests will travel through the bayou as they prepare to host a one-of-a-kind Mardi Gras celebration and listen to joyous music inspired by songs from the fan-favorite film. Paying tribute to the region where the film takes places was of the utmost importance to the ride's creators. According to a press release, \"Walt Disney Imagineers have been frequent travelers to Louisiana while conducting extensive research to ensure Tiana's Bayou Adventure preserves the heart and soul of the city that inspired Princess Tiana's story.\" \"From exploring the French Market and the bayou, to consulting with academics, chefs, musicians and cultural institutions, Imagineers have received inspiration from all over the region and learned from local experts along the way,\" Carmen Smith, Walt Disney's Senior Vice President of Creative Development, said in a press release. She added, \"To be able to join New Orleans in the celebration of Black joy as we bring Tiana's story to its roots is a full-circle moment I'm so proud to realize.\" The company and its imagineers knew they had to encapsulate the local flavor that Tiana's hometown holds for anyone and everyone who enjoys the ride. \"In many ways, Tiana's Bayou Adventure is a love letter to New Orleans,\" Executive Producer of Relevancy Activations Charita Carter said at the event. \"Like the musical city that inspired this attraction, Tiana's second act is about a community working in harmony to achieve something extraordinary. She reminds us of an immutable truth we can all relate to: 'If you do your best each and every day, good things are sure to come your way.' And that's a melody we can allsing along to!\" Tiana's story takes over the ride previously based on the controversial 1946 Disney filmSong of the South, which has long been criticized for its problematic portrayal of the post-Civil War South and for employing racist stereotypes. The 2020 announcement of its reimagining came just weeks afterseveral petitionsurging Disney to rework the theme of the popular ride garnered attention on the site Change.org  —onetitled \"Re-theme Splash Mountain to Princess and the Frog\" received over 21,384 signatures upon closing. The petition read in part: \"Disney parks should be a home for all to enjoy regardless of race, age, whatever your background may be . . . While the ride is considered a beloved classic, its history and storyline are steeped in extremely problematic and stereotypical racist tropes from the 1946 filmSong of the South. There is a huge need for diversity in the parks and this could help fill that need.\" Disney noted at the time that a new story for the ride had long been under consideration. RELATED: Princess and the Frog Stars 'Thrilled' About Update to Splash Mountain: 'I'm Here for It!'

The two eventually signed an NDA about the proceedings and moved on, though Heard later said the situationcost her several jobs. The former couple spent much of 2020 and 2021 in court for a libel case against U.K.'sThe Sun,which labeled Depp a \"wife-beater.\" Depp lost the suitand the appeal. Spielberg's first marriage, to actress Irving, lasted just four years, but produced one of the largest settlements in Hollywood,reportedat being as much as $100 million. One of the largest Hollywood divorce payouts ever was betweenGibson and Moore, whofinalized their divorceafter nearly 30 years of marriage in 2011 and split half of his $850 million fortune, with Moore’s settlement totaling $425 million. Their2008 splitwas an intense one, and ultimately, it was reported that Madonnapaid Ritchiebetween $76 million to $92 million. However, the drama between the two was only beginning: most recently, they were involved in abitter custody battleover their son, Rocco. Basinger and Baldwin's divorce drama lasted for four years, mostly due to a custody battle over their daughter, Ireland. Their split was also full of name-calling; some of the insults thrown out included \"black widow\" and \"tin pot tyrant.\" Basinger also said that she dreamt about Baldwin's death. Things have gotten better since 2002, though: she recently toldNet-A-Porter'sThe Editthat the two are \"cool now.\" Another volatile celebrity divorce came in 2006 for Sheen and Richards.In court documents, Richards alleged that Charlie was abusive, slept with prostitutes during their marriage and tried to prevent his daughters from receiving common vaccinations. In released emails, Sheen called Richards a \"sad jobless pig.\" They announced their plans to divorcejust three years after they wed. The former president's divorce from his first wife, Ivana, wasn't just expensive, it was dramatic. Trump cheated on Ivana with his eventual second wife, Marla Maples, in a scandal that claimed many a headline. Famously, Maples confronted Ivana in Aspen, where she reportedly said, \"I'm Marla and I love your husband. Do you?\" according to an interview Ivana gave to Barbara Walters. Reportedly, Ivanasaid to Maples, \"You bitch, leave my husband alone.\" The divorce soon followed, with anestimated settlementof $25 million. Another high-profile celebrity divorce was Ford’s split with ex-wife Mathison in 2004. The divorce came after 21 years of marriage and Mathison walked away with a large chunk of Ford’s earnings after their settlement — $85 million, according toForbes. They were seen around the world as a fairy tale come true, but the reality for Charles and Diana was far from it. Both were unfaithful throughout the marriage, and separated in 1992. There was talk of reconciliation, but after Diana’s famedPanoramainterview in 1995, it seemed the marriages was destined to go south. The royals officially divorced in 1996, just one year before Diana’s death.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Harry Belafonte, the Jamaican-American singer, songwriter, actor and activist whose music helped break Caribbean music through to a global audience, and whose humanitarian efforts changed the world, has died. He was 96. Reps for the musician confirmed in a press release that Belafonte died Tuesday morning \"of congestive heart failure at his New York home at the age of 96, his wife Pamela [Frank] by his side.\" Last year, the \"Jump in the Line\" performer was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Early Influence category. He was the oldest living person to join the organization. In one of his final acts of charity, the singer celebrated his 94th birthday in March 2021 with a star-studded virtual party that raised money forThe Gathering for Justice, a social justice organization he founded in 2005.The Gathering for Harryfeatured performances and guest appearances from entertainers and religious and political leaders like Common, Danny Glover, Chuck D, Bernie and Jane Sanders, Stacey Abrams, Aloe Blacc, Tamika D. Mallory, Rev. Al Sharpton and Jackie Cruz. Born Harold George Bellanfanti Jr. in Harlem, New York on March 1, 1927, Belafonte spent his youth shuffling between the city and his mother's native Jamaica (his father was from Martinique, and he had two White grandparents). \"My mother took us there to avoid the pressures and the pains of New York,\" he toldThe Scotsmanin 2012. \"She took us there because it was easier to raise a child in the village than it was on the streets of New York.\" After a brief stint in the Navy, he befriended Paul Robeson, who would go on to become his mentor, and began his recording career in 1949 after working his way through the New York City club scene. Though he began as a jazz act, and then a pop singer, he'd started performing folk music by 1950, and soon, his star was on the rise, according to a 1996New Yorkerarticle. Following the release of his first album in 1954, Belafonte expanded his talents to the silver screen, breaking racial barriers in critically acclaimed hits likeCarmen Jones, which co-starred Dorothy Dandridge. He also won a Tony Award for his performance in the Broadway musicalAlmanac. Though his marriage to first wife Margurite crumbled around that time (\"I just found the show-biz world to be shallow, and false,\" she told theNew Yorker), Belafonte was on the cusp of a breakthrough. In 1956, he releasedCalypso, which topped theBillboardcharts and sold more than 1 million copies, earning him the nickname \"King of Calypso.\" The album contained timeless hits such as \"Day-O (Banana Boat Song),\" a traditional Jamaican folk song that would go on to become Belafonte's signature track. Belafonte's version was inducted into theGrammy Hall of Famein 2009. In 2019, Belafonte told theLibrary of Congressthat he received pushback from \"everybody\" at the time for wanting to record an album of calypso songs. \"They thought me doing it was an affront to the many great calypso artists,\" he said. \"That I was invading somehow. But I had this history in my back pocket. I had grown up in the Caribbean and in Jamaica and I thought it was a good idea... Well, the authorities at RCA didn't. They said it would have no audience. It was just not a recognized genre in that day.\" Of \"Day-O,\" Belafonte said that he believes the song's enduring popularity comes from the contagiousness of its melody. \"I always invited participation when I performed it and the audience always happily jumped in,\" he said. \"It became a regular part of my routine. Even on the street, I would see people and they'd yell, 'Hey, 'Day-O'!' I took it as a badge of honor.\" In addition to his music successes, Belafonte also carried on his screen career, winning an Emmy in 1960 for outstanding performance in a variety or musical program forThe Revlon Revue: Tonight With Belafonte.The honor made him the first Black person to win an Emmy, according toThe Hollywood Reporter. It was around that time that Belafonte's popularity soared, withLookmagazine declaring him \"one of the most acclaimed entertainers in America today, [and] the first Negro matinée idol in our entertainment history,\" according to theNew Yorker. Belafonte was also known for his activism, and had advocated over the years for civil rights and other political and humanitarian causes, such as the Anti-Apartheid Movement and USA for Africa. In 1968, he became the first Black person to host a late-night TV show when heassumed hosting dutiesonThe Tonight Showamid national civil rights protests, welcoming guests like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy. \"When Dr. King called me in the first instance, I think he reached out for me because he needed to reach out to a much broader constituency than he had been serving,\" Belafonteonce said of his first meetingwith the then-24-year-old King. \"He said, 'You know, I don't know all that will be... I don't know where this goes. All I do know is that I am compelled to go with it... At the end I told him, 'I make the commitment, I'm in. I have no idea where this will go either, but I will stay the course no matter what.\" King's assassination in 1968 rendered Belafonte \"immobile — physically and emotionally and psychologically,\" he toldThe Scotsman. The accolades accumulated by Belafonte over the years are endless; he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 1987, and received a National Medal of the Arts from President Bill Clinton in 1994. In 2000, he was honored with the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award, and two years later, he received the Bishop John T. Walker Distinguished Humanitarian Service Award for his efforts to assist Africa from Africare. He's been recognized by everyone from the NAACP and ACLU, to the Peace Corps and the Boy Scouts of America. He has been involved in advocacy for prostate cancer since 2006, when he was diagnosed with and eventually beat the disease. Additionally, the American Association of Retired People (AARP) named Belafonte one of nine recipients of the 2006 Impact Award. \"One of my father's songs has a line about 'A secret soldier with pieces inside broke,' and that's how I see him,\" his daughter Adrienne told theNew Yorkerin 1996. \"He wants to fix the world, and he's sad because he sees it slipping away. I believe he feels alone.\" Belafonte has also received honorary degrees from several higher learning institutions, including Spelman College, City University of New York, Tufts University, Brandeis University, Long Island University, Bard College, and Columbia University, from which he received a Doctor of Humane Letters. \"This last period of my life is absolutely fascinating to me,\" he toldThe New York Timesin 2017. \"I'm like, I'm outside, looking at a story, and I have no idea what's on the next page — none.\" He married his third wife, photographer Pamela Frank, in 2008, and is survived by children Adrienne Belafonte Biesemeyer, Shari Belafonte, David Belafonte and Gina Belafonte as well as two stepchildren Sarah Frank and Lindsey Frank. He also has eight grandchildren: Rachel Blue Biesemeyer, Brian Biesemeyer, Maria Belafonte McCray, Sarafina Belafonte, Amadeus Belafonte, Mateo Frank, Olive Scanga and Zoe Frank.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

Gia documented the moment they reunited with a selfie of the family that she captioned, “we’re back❤️.” The family has been separated for over three years, since Joe first went to prison in March 2016. On Friday, the family patriarch shared a sweet photo of the entire family while on an outing together in Sala Consilina, a town in southwest Italy. TheReal Housewives of New Jerseystar — who has been living in Italy as he awaits his final deportation ruling — stood in the center of the photo with the rest of his family by his side. “Italian strong,” he captioned the image, adding an Italian flag emoji.

Joe wasreleased from prisonlast year but was held in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Clinton County Correctional Center in Pennsylvania, awaiting a decision on his deportation ruling. Though Joe has lived in the United States since he was a child,he never obtained American citizenship, and immigrants can be deported if they are convicted of “a crime of moral turpitude” or an “aggravated felony,” according to U.S. law.

A final ruling is expected in November. A petition to be released back to his home wasn’t granted, but arequest to go to Italy was. This October, he was released from ICE custody and flew to Italy, where he has been ever since. On Oct. 27, Joe appeared in his first television interview since he went to prison in March 2016, chatting via satellite with Teresa in aWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohenspecial. There, it was revealed that Teresa would be traveling to Italy this week to see Joe, alongside their four daughters. The Giudice family reunion will be documented by Bravo cameras for aRHONJspecial, Cohen said.

We’ll know when we see each other.” Although they both maintained that they still love each other, Teresa again said she would have no choice but to divorce Joe if he is indeed deported. “I want to wake up with someone every single day,” Teresa said, explaining that her kids understood. “I think they get it. I don’t think they want to see it happen, obviously, but I think they understand. Because the way I explained it to them, how are we going to live apart? I don’t think he would be faithful.

On Tuesday, the reality star announced his first picture book,Peanut Goes for the Gold,about a gender nonbinary guinea pig who dreams big. “Growing up, the things that made me unique were not always celebrated, and I wanted to do something that would inspire kids to celebrate the things that make them special,” Van Ness, 32, tells PEOPLE in an exclusive statement. “With that being said, I’m so excited to announce my debut children’s book,Peanut Goes for the Gold, an inspiring story of a guinea pig rhythmic gymnastics prodigy.” The guinea pig, Peanut, has a unique style.

InJason Priestley: A Memoir,theBeverly Hills 90210star recalled that they used to have competitions over who could go the longest without showering or shaving. Clearly, Pitt thought Priestley could use some religion in his life - because for Christmas in 1989, Pitt gave Priestley and their other pals monogrammed Bibles. (You'll want to hear Priestley tell it.) Before hitting it big withCrazy Ex-Girlfriend(for Bloom) andBroad City(for Glazer) they were just two aspiring actresses, bunking together in Brooklyn - and the two are still tight. \"6 years ago we were roommates in Brooklyn and now we have tv shows,\" Bloom captioned a collage of photos of the two on Instagram. \"@ilanusglazer is just the best.\" The two handsome U.K. expats crossed the pond together and shared a flat in L.A. while trying to hit it big. Dornan recalled their \"desperate\" early yearswhile onThe Late Late Show with James Corden,joking about the fact that they would often be sent the exact same scripts. For a summer when they were both Dartmouth students studying abroad in Beijing, the actress and the junior U.S. Senator from New York. The two have remained close, with Britton calling Gillibrand \"fearless\" and Gillibrand commending Britton for only taking on parts that she felt were role model-worthy. When Gillibrand competed for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination,Britton was vocal in her support. Gillibrand was just one of Britton's famous roommates. When the actress was just starting out in Hollywood, she andGilmore Girls'Lauren Grahamcamped out together in an empty house. \"We lived in an empty house that we weren't supposed to be living in,\" Graham toldAndy CohenonWatch What Happens Live. \"We had no furniture and all we ate were Rice Krispies Treats.\" Hey, life could be a lot worse. They're clearly still pals: Grahamwished Britton a happy birthdaywith an epic throwback photo of the two of them from 1999. The Oscar-winning actresses also struck gold when they decided to be roommates in the early '80s. They were introduced through their boyfriends, who were best friends at the time. \"The four of us hit it off, and we all moved to the North Bronx,\"Hunter toldVulture. \"We got two apartments, one for each couple. Then we broke up with our boyfriends and Fran moved in with me ... Fran's as fabulous as she seems. We had a blast.\" Perks of having an older roommate? Taking advantage of the privileges your age won't allow you to use. For Badgley, that was using his 10-years-older roommate Ventimiglia's ID to get past bouncers. \"When I was 18, my roommate was Milo Ventimiglia, who was 28 at the time,\" Badgley reportedly toldBullettmagazine. \"I used to borrow his ID to get into bars. I've still got it somewhere.\" Guess that gives Ventimiglia the chillest roommate ever award. Back in their Disney darling days, Raven-Symoné and Lohan signed a lease on an apartment together. Though they were roommates on paper, they weren't exactly living with one another in practice. \"She paid rent, and she was there probably three times,\" Symoné toldUs Weeklyabout her former roomie. \"She had her clothes in the apartment we were supposed to live in together.\" The two famous funnymen shared a $900/month apartment in L.A., and inan interview with CBS'60 Minutes Overtime, Apatow ribbed Sandler for some of his stranger roommate habits, including sleeping on a mattress without sheets and renting a car instead of buying one \"for literally 12 years.\" They enjoyed living together (and making monthly roomie trips to Red Lobster), but when Sandler got cast onSaturday Night Live, he relocated to N.Y.C. - but continued to pay rent on the off chance he would get fired and have to return. \"He just left, like he was going to come back, but he just didn't come back,\" Apatow said. The duo were roommates in N.Y.C. in the 1960s and have stayed close pals ever since.

The two lived together while filming the hit series, but they didn't allow any workplace drama to affect the way they felt about one another at home. \"We have these smackdowns at work and come home and are like, 'Wasn't it so funny when we were fighting today? Let's make cookies!'\"Michele toldNew York Magazine. \"It works out. We're both vegans. Well, I was. I slowly dipped back into cheese.\" Everyone knows that Affleck and Damon go way, way back. So it's no surprise that in their early years of fame, the two split the rent to make ends meet. However, their first endeavor as roommates ended in debt. \"We rented this house on the beach in Venice and 800 people came and stayed with us and got drunk,\" Afflecksaid. \"Then we ran out of money and had to get an apartment.\" Such is life - even for a star!

Wilson and Anderson, who first met in a script writing class at the University of Texas at Austin.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: After a week without help, Luis DeJesus got out the white paint. “S.O.S.,” read the letters he brushed onto the asphalt entrance to his housing complex. “NECESITAMOS AGUA/COMIDA.” Translation: “We need water/food.” “They haven’t brought anything to us,” DeJesus said Thursday afternoon, as his wife and three children headed down the drive from the house they remained in, even as the storm surge fromHurricane Mariaon Sept. 20 brought the ocean up to their thighs. “I lost everything. We haven’t had food or water for seven days. The governor passed through here. He didn’t stop. He just went to the beach for some pictures and left.” The beach is just across the road. This is the eastern coast of Puerto Rico, not far from wherethe eye of Mariamade landfall. DeJesus pulled out his phone and played a video of the water rising inside his house. “I have gas to cook, but I don’t have food,” DeJesus said. As he spoke, a white Toyota Highlander swung into the drive. Three doors and its hatchback popped open, and a handful of young people ran over with white plastic bags. Inside was rice, canned sausages, cookies. There was a bag of bottled water. “We’re a non-profit Puerto Rican group of young people,” said a slender young man in a ball cap. He identified himself as Jorge Pagan, executive director ofPuerto Rico Cambia, or “Change.” Pagan said his group has seven collection points around the island, and a church in San Juan brimming with provisions. But it was not allowed to make more than the token distributions they had just delivered to DeJesus, like an answered prayer. “The problem that is happening,” he said, “is the government is taking control of everything.” At a news conference in San Juan on Friday morning, one U.S. official after another acknowledged that the aid response appears sluggish. “It’s not nearly as fast as everybody wants us to do,” said John Rabin, regional director of FEMA, blaming the comprehensive damage of the fifth-most-powerful hurricane ever to strike the U.S. Addressing the containers of private aid piling up at the port, Gov. Ricardo Rossello said the government would buy their contents and distribute them—though the U.S. official in charge of coordinating the federal response said that the supply chains required to do so have yet to be established. “Commodity delivery–that has been a challenge,” said the official, Alejandro de la Campa, who said it was the government’s top priority. When the general in charge of the 4,600 U.S. troops now in Puerto Rico stepped to the microphone, he kept it short. “This response is going to take time,” Lt. Gen. Jeff Buchanan said. President Trump plans to visit the island on Oct. 3. Meanwhile, back on the coast, at least DeJesus’s family had been served. “I feel happy now,” said his wife, Yennifer Ortiz. “I have three kids.” But there was nothing for the dozens of other homes in their complex. Just down the road, a National Guard unit was clearing debris from the streets, but offering little else. “They only gave us two bottles of water every two days. They’re not distributing any food,” said Bernarda Vazquez, 59, who after being evacuated the day before Maria hit had moved back into her two-room house, a block and a half from the water. She said the damage—the toppled buildings closer to the sea, a car that had drifted to the curb in front of her house, its interior caked with muddy sand—was worse than Hurricane Hugo, which struck this island of 3.4 million people in 1989. “We didn’t have electricity for two months, but everything happened fast because FEMA acted fast,” Vazquez recalled. “You can’t compare the disasters because this was so much worse. They’re acting too slow, but I’m not bothered because the whole island was in danger.” Not everyone is so understanding. Across the street, Gloria Viera leaned on the rake she had been using to scrape her belongings out of her house. “We haven’t received any aid,” she said. “A couple of days ago the National Guard brought one bottle of water per person.” “We have no help,” said her husband Sammy Pagan, 47. “We’re working, and the community is helping out. That’s what I’ve seen.” Thespirit of communitydoes stand out here. Police appear to be where they need to be: directing traffic under darkened traffic lights, or, in aMad Maxtouch, escorting tanker trucks bearing precious gasoline to the stations where cars queue for blocks, their drivers often waiting five hours to fill up. But where an immediate need appears, ordinary people step right up, taking charge of traffic outside one of the few open supermarkets or acting as flaggers around streets blocked by debris (which, after more than a week, is taking the shape of manageable piles). “Together As One” was the message painted onto a tattered Puerto Rican flag draped over a shuttered hotel in San Juan. It’s the government response that appears to be lagging. For all the aid arriving on the island—and the hundreds of officials that have turned the San Juan convention center into an air-conditioned beehive—it is very hard to find any out in the countryside. In a four-hour drive around the island’s northeast section, a TIME reporter saw only a truck dispensing potable water and just two crews from the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Left on his own in his ruined living room, Sammy Pagan worked to keep a brave face. He had spent the worst hours of Maria with his entire weight braced against the door of an inland house where his family had taken refuge. “Those were two hours in my life of: ‘Please, morning come, morning come.’ Because in the light, you can see what’s happening. But in the night, it’s the sound. It’s like the hurricane is talking.” The aftermath has not been great either. Pagan and his wife have pushed household belongings into the street like garbage, and he worries the factory where he works, which was badly damaged, might not re-open. “I don’t have a mind for anything else,” Pagan said. “Just cleaning the house. Helping my family.” He paused, lifting his arms up from his side in a hopeless gesture. His eyes watered. “We say we’ll make it together, everyone is helping out. But, wow. “Some moment, I don’t know when, I need to scream or to cry or something. I haven’t been able to, because of the family. I need to be supportive. But I need to do it. I’m so strained.” After another pause, he looked up. “But we are U.S. citizens, and we deserve more help. We deserve it. We are U.S. citizens.” Thisarticleoriginally appeared on Time.com\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: When it comes to Twitter, it looks like President Donald Trump has some competition. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was one of a wave of new faces joining Congress earlier this month, made C-SPAN history when a video of her speech from the House floor went viral on Twitter on Thursday. “In just over 12 hours C-SPAN tweet of [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s] floor remarks last nite have become most-viewed twitter video by @cspan of any remarks by a member of House either party. 1.16M,” wrote Howard Mortman, the broadcaster’s communications director. He then confirmed that Sen. Kamala Harris holds the record for most-watched tweet video of the Senate, with 7.14 million views. As of Friday afternoon, the just-over four minute video had 2.48 million views. That record-breaking stat follows arecent study of total engagement on Twitter, in December and January. While Trump ranked far and away at No. 1, Ocasio-Cortez — unknown a year ago — was No. 2. In her floor speech, the 29-year-old congresswoman — also referred to by the abbreviation “AOC” — drew attention to individuals suffering in a historic government shutdown precipitated by the president’s call for a southern border wall. Ocasio-Cortezoutlined how an air traffic controller in the Bronx,whom she represents, is suffering as he misses paychecks. (Some 800,000 federal workers are going without pay.) “It is terrifying to think that almost every single air traffic controller in the United States is currently distracted at work because they don’t know when their next paycheck is coming,” she said. Then she went wide, criticizing Trump, who has refused to pass a spending bill until he is given money for a wall. The president has argued a barrier is needed to stem a so-called “crisis” of drugs, violence and human trafficking coming over from Mexico. He has implored Democrats to negotiate with him while refusing to concede on the one thing they say he cannot have. In return, empowered by the midterms, Democrats have dismissed a wall as immoral and ineffective.

And this president shares in that responsibility as well, which means he has a responsibility to my constituent.” Michael Cohen Slams Trump in First Post-Sentencing Interview: ‘The Man Doesn’t Tell the Truth’ Ocasio-Cortez’s facility with social media, her progressive politics and her star-making story (rocketing to national prominence less than a year ago when she won her primary unexpectedly) have made her a target of fascination and scorn, depending on the viewpoint. Not only has she beenbooed by some of her new Republican colleagues in Congress, a Twitter user’s attack went viral after he tried to demean her with an old clip of her dancing in college. “Here is America’s favorite commie know-it-all acting like the clueless nitwit she is” the anonymous account wrote alongside the clip. (The tweet was later removed.) In actuality, the footage was froma larger videoput together by Boston University students in 2010, CNN reports. Ocasio-Cortez graduated from there in 2011. She soon responded to the apparent trolling … by tweeting out another dance video, this one outside her Congressional office. I hear the GOP thinks women dancing are scandalous.

And her colleagues loved it. Some of her advice? “Social media is not just for young people,” she said, ABC reports. “Sometimes the culture here is to fit in and keep your heads low,” she said.

Pocan's back-and-forth with Amazon comes as the companyhas been criticized by labor advocates for working againsta unionizing effort on behalf of nearly 6,000 warehouse employees in Alabama. Democrats have rallied around the unionization effort, which is awaiting the results of a vote, PresidentJoe Bidentold the workers in a video message last month \"it's your right\" to choose whether to join a union.

If that were true, nobody would work for us,\" the company's Twitter account wrote back. Amazon apologized for its brash response over the weekend, saying the tweet \"was an own-goal, we're unhappy about it, and we owe an apology to Representative Pocan.\" The company admitted \"the tweet was incorrect\" and that drivershave reportedhaving to take bathroom breaks in their vehicles while on the job.

This \"is a long-standing, industry-wide issue and is not specific to Amazon,\" the company said. \"We would like to solve\" the issue though \"we don't yet know how.\" Pocan offered up one idea in his Twitter response: \"Start by acknowledging the inadequate working conditions you've created for ALL your workers, then fix that for everyone & finally, let them unionize without interference.\" A spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment on Monday.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

RELATED:Karamo Brown Says His Sons Received ‘Death Threats’ After His Controversial Sean Spicer Comments “Through this process, Sean’s trailer has been next to mine and I have literally every day been planting seeds in his heart,” Brown said on Monday. “‘When you made this comment, it hurt me as a man. When you made this comment, it hurt me as a person of color. When you made this comment, it hurt me as a gay man.’ And literally, I could see each week those seeds … blossoming and that’s why he got emotional [when I was sent home].” “He got emotional because he’s realizing that I’m not someone you should be attacking in the media,” Brown continued. “I’m a human being. And if I can touch his heart, I’m about to go through and make a tour of Washington! I still want Trump out of office, but you know. That was the goal [with Spicer]. That was the goal.” Brown — who first gained fame onThe Real World: Philadelphiaand became a political activist, working with the Obama administration on after-school programs for LGBTQ youth — also said he’s “proud” of Spicer. “Sean is literally someone who I would’ve never thought I could be friends with, and I’m going to walk away from here calling him a friend,” he said. “I’m going to continue the conversation that we’ve had outside of this. And I don’t think Sean’s going to make it to the end [of the competition], but I’m proud of him. I really am proud of him, because he’s had fun every week and I think he’s exceptional.” RELATED:Sean Spicer Survives Another Week onDancing with the Stars—  Infuriating Twitter Spicer, 48, echoed Brown’s sentiments during his own interview with reporters after Monday’s show. “It just speaks to what a great person he is, that he’s trying to bridge divides,” Spicer said of his “friend” Brown supporting him from the get-go. “I think that it’s been great getting to know him, getting to discuss things with him. And so it’s tough to watch somebody that you’ve really got close to go home when you know how hard they’ve worked and how much progress they’ve made.” Following the backlash this summer, Browntemporarily deactivated his Twitter accountand turned off the comments feature on his Instagram. During an interview onCatt Sadler‘sNakedpodcastlast month, he said his break from social media came after his kids began receiving“death threats”over the controversy, recalling a particularly scary instance where his son was chased down the street in Philadelphia while people yelled profanity at him. “He was running home because somebody was in a car chasing after him in the car screaming at him! ‘F you and your dad! You’re going to die!'” he said. “That’s what I don’t like. That’s the part that really makes me emotional and gets me upset. When I have to squeeze my hands — the Daddy protective in me is just like, don’t do that.” “The hate started coming at me. And normally I can handle the hate, because I’m okay with having constructive conversations, but what I realized is that places like Twitter, you can’t have constructive conversations,” he continued. “It’s the mob mentality. And so once the mob feels like they have their target, they’re going to get you. … And then it was really the first tweet I saw where they @ my child as well — I was like, done! And I got off of it.” RELATED:Sean Spicer Says He Expected Backlash for JoiningDWTS —‘I Can Take a Couple Tweets’ Still, Brown said while his “natural instinct is to be kind to every human being,” he understood why some people were upset with him. “I am not delusional.

In Canada, Prime MinisterJustin Trudeauhas grown a beard. This isn’t exactly as silly as it seems: Trudeau, son of one of Canada’s most famous prime ministers (before he followed in his father’s footsteps) has not been shy about discussing what he considers his deftness with his own image — which helped launch him to international recognition. But Trudeau, 48, entered 2020 both weaker and stronger than he could have been. He won re-election in the fall, overcoming notable controversies, but his party lost its majority in the Canadian House of Commons. His new facial hair — a bithistory-making, according to various outlets, as a Canadian leader had not sported a beard for many decades — made headlines and set-off speculation and jokes. The tone was somewhere between tongue-in-cheek and throat-clearing. RELATED:Justin Trudeau Welcomes Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to Canada for Their Holiday Stay “[It’s] more of a mature look, especially with the gray coming through,” outside consultant Lynne Mackaytold the BBC, adding, “There is a certain level of maturity that he’s projecting with this beard, there’s no doubt about it.” “It’s an attempt by Trudeau to act the part of a mature statesman,” one usersuggestedon Twitter Tuesday.

What Does It Mean?” And then of coursefrom the Canadian Press: “Everything you need to know (and a few things you don’t) about Justin Trudeau’s beard.” The prime minister’s official photographer started the whole thingwhen on Monday he shareda striking image of a salt-and-pepper-bearded Trudeau. Trudeau, who appeared on the cover ofRolling Stonein 2017, has long taken the idea of his “brand” into consideration, according to an August profilein theThe Guardian. “There is not a single action that he took publicly that wasn’t considered, reconsidered and put out there in an attempt to eventually build the base that he would require to be prime minister,” political analyst Ian Capstick told the paper. Capstick added that that he believed Trudeau (who grew up while his father was prime minister) has with his team “been carefully calculating every single entree of Mr. Trudeau into Canadian public life for the past 30 years.” RELATED:Justin Trudeau and Melania Trump’s G7 Cheek Kiss Goes Viral AsThe Guardiannoted, in 2012 Trudeau held a boxing match with a rival conservative lawmaker to help bolster his public perception.

Elliott (@joshkelliott)January 6, 2020 After he became prime minister in 2015, Trudeau — young, articulate, charismatic and handsome — was often paired in the media with PresidentBarack Obama, his fellow liberal world leader. After Trump took office in 2017, Trudeau became a kind of foil. Throughout, he has gone viral for all manner of minor things, likejogging shirtlessandtalking about quantum computing. But he’s grappled with scandal as well, including repeated revelations about himwearing blackface and brownfacewhile in costume when he was younger. He apologized. More seriously, he wasaccused last yearof intervening to prevent harsher penalties for a companycharged with bribery. (He has said he was just trying to save jobs.) In October, his Liberal Party won re-election, albeit with fewer seats. Since Trudeau became the Liberal leader in 2013, he largely stuck to a clean-shaven look. And then this. TheCanadian Press, assessing the situation on Monday, found “his new beard is neatly trimmed and flecked liberally with grey. It seems to match Trudeau’s stated intention to take a lower profile, more businesslike approach to his second mandate, keeping the focus on concrete bread-and-butter initiatives and shifting the spotlight to his team of cabinet ministers.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

AsThe New York Timesnotes, this wasn’t the first time the president tried to dismiss an allegation of sexual assault or misconduct by decrying the accuser’s physical appearance. (He has denied all wrongdoing.) During his 2016 campaign, when a woman said he had reached up her skirt on an airplane, Trump told supporters: “Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you.” After former PEOPLE writerNatasha Stoynoffwent public with her account of him forcibly kissing her while she was interviewing him in December 2005, Trump said in 2017, “Look at her. Look at her words. Tell me what you think. I don’t think so.” Responding to her a year earlier, while campaigning for president, Trump had said, “Check out her Facebook page — you’ll understand.” RELATED:Noted Advice Columnist Says Trump Raped Her in Manhattan Department Store in the ’90s — ‘Never Happened,’ Trump Responds The president has been accused of sexual assault or misconduct by more than a dozen women. He has steadfastly denied the allegations and repeatedly claimed he does not know the women involved despite, as in Stoynoff’s case,there being evidence the two had met. After Carroll came forward late last week, Trump said in an initial statement he had never met her either, though there was a photo of them together published in her piece recounting the alleged assault. (Asked about that by reporters on Saturday, he said, “[I was] standing with coat on in a line — give me a break — with my back to the camera.”) In an excerpt from her forthcoming book,published on Friday inNew Yorkmagazine, Carroll wrote that Trump raped her in Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan in the mid ’90s. In unsparing detail in the excerpt, from her memoirWhat Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal, Carroll recalled allegedly running into Trump in the department store in Manhattan in either late 1995 or early 1996 and his subsequent attack on her in a dressing room. At the time, Carroll was the host of a cable advice show. For nearly 30 years she has been the author of an eponymous advice column forElle, the longest-running such column in the country. She wrote that she did not report the incident to police and there were no witnesses; Bergdorf Goodman said they had no security footage from that time period, according toNew York. However, two unnamed friends of Carroll’s confirmed toNew Yorkthat she told them what happened at the time. “He raped you,” one friend told Carroll, according to her excerpt. “He raped you. Go to the police! I’ll go with you. We’ll go together.” RELATED:Physically Attacked by Donald Trump — a PEOPLE Writer’s Own Harrowing Story In his statement responding to her, the president noted the lack of witnesses, surveillance video or a police report and suggested, without evidence, that Carroll might have worked with political rivals in telling her story. “False accusations diminish the severity of real assault,” Trump said. “All should condemn false accusations and any actual assault in the strongest possible terms.” “It is a disgrace and people should pay dearly for such false accusations,” he said. According to Carroll, she ran into Trump as she was about to leave Bergdorf Goodman. The two had met before, Carroll wrote. Trump “look[ed] prettier than ever” and he asked her for advice on what kind of gift he should buy for an unnamed woman. (He was married at the time toMarla Maples, with whom he shares daughterTiffany Trump.) Eventually the two made their way to the store’s lingerie section and into a dressing room where, according to Carroll, she believed she would succeed in having Trump jokingly try on a piece of women’s clothing. Instead, in the room, Trump attacked her as she fought back, she wrote.

After testing positive for cocaine eight months after her win, Conner wasallowed to keep her titleby pageant ownerDonald Trumpon the agreement thatshe enter rehab. It was a move that would force her to confront her addiction and help save her life. Now 30 years old, Conner has been sober for a little over nine-and-a-half years. “My life is really beautiful,” Conner toldOprah: Where Are They Now?. And while Conner doesn’t directly thank the now-Republican presidential nominee for getting her sober, she says she appreciates how he put addiction and recovery into the national spotlight. “When he sent me to treatment, it was a huge step forward for the recovery movement,” Conner said on the OWN show. “Absolutely.” “I’ve always been a believer in second chances,” Trump said at the time. “Tara is good person. Tara has tried hard. Tara is going to be given a second chance.” His move in 2006 also resulted in anasty feudwithRosie O’Donnell, who criticized the real-estate mogul’s decision to give Conner a second chance. “He’s the moral authority… for 20-year-olds in America?” she asked onThe View,bringing upTrump’s affairs,divorces,previous bankruptciesandhistory of not playing his employees. The comments spurred years’ worth of attacks from Trump about O’Donnell’sweight and sexual orientationthat have continued to this day, and were even brought upduring Sept. 26’s presidential debate. As for Conner, she’s spending her time focused on recovery advocacy — teaching how addiction is a disease that needs to be treated longterm, and helping those that don’t have a voice. “I like to do a lot of work in prevention, focusing on adolescence, because that’s where this starts,” she said. “I think a lot of people search for a purpose their entire life and never find one, and I had one fall in my lap.” But it took her awhile to get there. “My struggle with addiction started when I was 14 years old,” she explained in a recent Instagram post. “I was dying a slow and painful death that I wouldn’t wish on anyone.” On pain pills the entire time she was competing in Miss USA, Conner’s dependence on drugs and alcohol “literally just became a way of life,” she toldOprahin 2010. But things didn’t get easier after her three-month stay in rehab, as she waitressed and sold cars to be able to support herself financially. “When I won Miss USA in 2006, for me, that was the ticket out,” the Kentucky native revealed toWhere Are They Now?. “I feel like what happened with me is my head got a little big and I thought, ‘Oh it’s always gonna be this easy’ and then life would happen.” RELATED VIDEO: Donald Trump on Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado: ‘She gained a massive amount of weight’ “It taught me a really great lesson — I couldn’t save my face and my butt at the same time,” she continued. “My comfort level was dependent on what other people thought of me.” Conner’s over that now, and uses her experiences to help others. “I tell the things I went through in hopes that it takes the shame out of other people,” she added. “I’ve seen the stigma. I’ve experienced it — I’ve felt the judgment and the shame, but I don’t have to live like that. And I’ve also experienced joy and compassion and empathy and love. I get to give that back to people.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The program, dubbed Project Believe 2020, is expected to last eight weeks The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) is trying out an unprecedented drug testing program for Olympic athletes. With coronavirus stay-at-home orders preventing the organization from sending unannounced testers to collect samples in-person, officials have now come up with a new possible plan: sending test kits to athletes’ homes and having them test themselves over video conferencing apps like FaceTime or Zoom while USADA personnel watches. It’s a process that’s beenpiloted for the past two weeks by about a dozen volunteer top Olympians so far,The New York Timesreported — including swimmers Katie Ledecky and Lilly King; wheelchair racer Tatyana McFadden; and runners Noah Lyles, Allyson Felix, Emma Coburn, and Aliphine Tuliamuk. And it’s one that may utilized moving forward, even after the pandemic ends. Not only does the new virtual program allow for safer conditions for testers, it’s also easier and less intrusive on athletes. “We’ve been talking about this and laying the foundation for several months,” USADA’s CEO Travis Tygart told theTimes. “COVID put that on fast forward and allowed us to roll it out.” The new procedure, dubbed Project Believe 2020, is built to prevent athletes from trying to cheat, too. Testing kits are sent to their homes beforehand. When notified it’s testing time by a doping control officer — a call that comes without warning —athletes must immediately log into a video conferencing program and show themselves taking their samples,The Washington Postreported. For their blood sample, athletes place a device on their arm that collects four droplets of blood with a quick prick that can be tested dry,thePostreported. As for their urine sample,athletes must first show USADA personnel the inside of their bathroom,USA Todayreports. They then leave the device outside during the collection process, while a doping control officer times them. A temperature monitor on the collection jar ensures the sample is fresh to stop athletes from potentially switching out a contaminated sample for untainted urine. Final blood and urine samples are sealed and sent back via overnight delivery to a laboratory for analysis,USA Todayreported. The whole process is said to take nearly the same amount of time as a traditional USADA test, thePostreported. Ledecky, who had her first test on Monday as she social distances from her apartment in Northern California, toldUSA Todayshe felt “very comfortable with the whole process.” “This is the perfect time to test something like this. I think it’s great for the circumstances we’re all in right now,” she said. “I’m willing to be tested any day, any time. It’s part of sport and part of my responsibility as an elite athlete to be drug tested and to compete clean. It’s something I feel very strongly about.” King admitted to the outlet that she was “a little skeptical of it at first,” but quickly came around after she did her first test. “They really thought through all the potential loopholes with the testing,” she said. “There are way too many factors that would go into providing a tainted sample for you to really pull that off during the test unless you were a ridiculously high-level crook,” she said, noting the importance of testing the urine temperature. “When you have a random test, it would be kind of hard to keep a fake sample at a certain temperature for weeks on end before you know that you’re going to have a test.” Project Believe 2020 is expected to last eight weeks,USA Todayreported. USADA has been the official anti-doping agency for the Olympic, Pan-American and Paralympic sport in the United States since 2001. Unannounced testing of top athletes is standard practice, and not being available for a drug test can be grounds for suspension. Meanwhile, last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach announced in a joint statement thatthe 2020 Olympic Summer Games would be postponedamid the COVID-19 outbreak. The delay is unprecedented,marking only the fourth time in modern Olympic history that the Games have been disrupted. “In the present circumstances and based on the information provided by the WHO today, the IOC President and the Prime Minister of Japan have concluded that the Games of the XXXII Olympiad in Tokyomust be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community,” read a statement from the IOC. According to the statement, the Olympic flame will remain in Japan during the delay. The Summer Games will also continue to be called “Tokyo 2020,” even as they are moved to 2021. “The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present,” the IOC’s statement continued.

The first surprise to be revealed was entitled “Cards Against Humanity stops the wall.” The company announced it had bought a piece of vacant land along theU.S.-Mexico borderand employed a law firm that specializes in fighting compulsory land acquisition. The aim, it said, was “to make it as time-consuming and expensive as possible for the wall to get built.” Of Trump, the company said: “Donald Trump is a preposterous golem who is afraid of Mexicans. He is so afraid that he wants to build a twenty-billion dollar wall that everyone knows will accomplish nothing.” The card game refused to comment on what the other five surprises would be. “The nature of a surprise is that it surprises you when it occurs,” the company said. This is not the first promotion from Cards Against Humanity to involve itself in social issues. Previously, the company has released a set of cards “for her,” identical in every way to the original set except for coming in a pink box, but costing $5 more to poke fun at the absurdity of the gender pay cap.

The Washington Postreports thatTrump will welcome executivesfrom Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Snap to the White House next Tuesday for a discussion on how to combat online harassment. Four people familiar with her efforts told thePostthat Trump plans to grill the tech company execs on what they’ve done to stop online trolls and the spread of “malicious content,” but noted that she is not expected to unveil any policy proposals on the issue. Asked about the reported meeting, a spokeswoman for Trump told thePostthat the first lady had “simply asked for a meeting to discuss one of the many things that impacts children.” Trump first pledged to combat the rise of cyberbullyinga few days before husband Donald Trump won the election in November 2016. Addressing supporters at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, the mother of son Barron, 11, promised to be an “advocate for women and for children” if her husband was elected president. “As adults, many of us are able to handle mean words, even lies. Children and teenagers can be fragile. Our culture has gotten too mean and too rough, especially to children and teenagers,” she said at the time. Many critics were quick to point out the irony of the first lady’s mission considering her husband’s well-documented habit of humiliating and lashing out at his foes on Twitter, often using degrading and evenracistnicknames.

Elections always matter. I'm incredibly happy right now,\" wrote activist and veteran Charlotte Clymer, in a tweet posted shortly after the announcement was made. The National Center for Transgender Equality celebrated the news as well, noting onTwitterthat there are some 134,000 trans veterans in the U.S. The group estimates about 15,000 people who are transgender are currently serving in the military. \"Everyone should have access to the health care they need to live healthy, happy lives,\" said Mara Keisling, the executive director for the National Center for Transgender Equality. \"We know that this is just the beginning of a long process, but it's another step in the Biden administration's effort to fight discrimination against transgender people, including our transgender veterans. Keisling added: \"Every veteran deserves to have access to the health care that they need, and the VA is working to make sure that includes transgender veterans as well.\" Currently, the Veterans Health Administration provides care for transgender veterans, but previous regulations excluded transition-related surgical care. On Saturday, Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough announced at a Pride Month event in Orlando that the Biden administration was changing that, after acknowledging the \"dark history\" of discrimination against LGBTQ service members in America. \"We're making these changes not only because they are the right thing to do, but because they can save lives,\" McDonough said, adding that the move will allow \"transgender vets to go through the full gender confirmation process with VA by their side.\" RELATED:An Army Vet's Unexpected Meeting with Biden After Sending Thank-You Letter for Ending Trans Ban The latest announcement comes just months after PresidentJoe Bidenoverturned former PresidentDonald Trump's 2018 prohibition on transgender people in the military. \"What I'm doing is enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform,\" Biden, 78, said upon signing an executive order in January that allows \"all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform.\" In February, McDonoughordered a reviewof the Veterans Affairs' department's policies to \"ensure that transgender Veterans and employees do not face discrimination on the basis of their gender identity and expression.\" Clymer, a 34-year-old transgender woman, previously spoke about her own experience serving in the military and criticized the Trump administration's transgender military ban, in a 2019commentary for CBS News. \"For over three years, I carried caskets in Arlington National Cemetery,\" Clymer wrote. \"I folded American flags for loved ones.

The retired neurosurgeon, who was confirmed to lead the department last week, spoke highly of immigrants in his first remarks to staff on Monday, praising their work ethic before making the startling comparison. “There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, who worked even longer, even harder, for less, but they too had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great grandsons, great granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land,” the 65-year-old said.

In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!!” “Ben Carson..please read or watch Roots, most immigrants come here VOLUNTARILY, can’t really say the same about the slaves..they were stolen,”Whoopi Goldbergtweeted. Carson later took toFacebookto clarify his statements, although he did not offer an apology. “The slave narrative and immigrant narrative are two entirely different experiences,” he wrote. “Slaves were ripped from their families and their homes and against their will after being sold into slavery by slave traders.” He expanded on his comments later on SiriusXM’sArmstrong Williams Show. “I think people need to actually look up the word immigrant,” he said. “Whether you’re voluntary or involuntary, if you come from outside to the inside, you’re an immigrant … slaves came here as involuntary immigrants. But they still had the strength to hold on.” This is not the first time Carson has made a shocking comparison to America’s shameful and inhumane history of slavery. In 2013, Carson said that theAffordable Care Act(also called Obamacare) was the worst thing “since slavery,” according toCNN.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: A decades-long legislative battle finally played out in Florida’s November elections, when 69 percent of the state’s voterschose to end commercial greyhound racing in a ban that takes effect Dec. 31, 2020. Amendment 13 ultimately will shut down 11 of the nation’s 17 currently active dog tracks, while others remain in Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Texas and West Virginia. But the vote hascreated new tension between those who supported the ban and those who opposed it. That battle is centered on what’s in store for Florida’s retiring racing greyhounds and who will help get the dogs vetted, transported and adopted. “That’s what’s at the top of everyone’s minds,” Kate MacFall, Florida State Director for theHumane Society of the United States,who co-chaired the Yes on 13 Campaign, tells PEOPLE. She and others who supported the ban have decried the dog racing industry’s stance on limiting access to adoptable greyhounds to organizations that opposed Amendment 13. “We think we’re, in some way, all on the same page now in terms of doing the right thing for the dogs,” MacFall says. “Hopefully, [those who opposed Amendment 13] will accept help from some of the groups they banned.” But that stance has been misconstrued as a matter of spite, says John Parker, Vice President ofGreyhound Adopters for Racing(GAR). “It’s not quite as organized as this blacklist talk,” Parker tells PEOPLE, explaining that 102 organizations were identified as potential adoption partners via a call for groups that urged a no-vote on Amendment 13 to post to the GAR’s Facebook page. “As groups saw this, they said, ‘We’re of a same mind.’ And so by leaps and bounds, the number grew and at last count, it was at 102 a week before the election.” While Parker confirms that those listed likely will be the first groups asked to take adoptable greyhounds, the decision ultimately is up to the dogs’ owners. “The dogs are owned by individuals or partnerships and leased to the racing kennel,” Parker explains. “Dogs are property of these people and they have the say as to what adoption groups the dogs go to for rehoming. Those people will be the ones, by and large, who determine which groups get their dogs.” Parker notes that additional racing-neutral organizations listed on theNational Greyhound Association‘s approved list of responsible adoption groups may also be engaged in the effort, which will be led by Glendale, Arizona-basedGreyhound Pets of America(GPA), the nation’s largest non-profit greyhound adoption group. The group will model its approach after previous efforts that followed other statewide bans and track closures. “Between those groups that are in the middle and the 102 no-vote groups, the owners are going to have a wide choice of groups that their dogs go to,” Parker says. “So the anti-racing groups, which are a fairly small minority, their help won’t be necessary.” Parker and others also note that by the time the ban takes effect at the close of 2020, there will be far fewer greyhounds wrapping their time on Florida’s tracks, in part because seasonal tracks will already have closed. While figures from varying sources have placed the number of greyhounds currently racing or in training in the state at between 8,000 and 15,000, the industry counters that the best supported figure currently is far closer to 4,800 with another 700 or 800 gearing up for the Sarasota’s seasonal track. The numbers will further dwindle over the next two years. “Owners are whelping fewer than 7,000 dogs a year now,” former greyhound trainer and outspoken racing supporter Dennis McKeon tells PEOPLE. “At the turn of the century, it was closer to 25,000.” GPA President Rory Goree agrees. “If this had happened 10 years ago, there would be a lot more greyhounds,” he says, noting that multiple legislative restrictions or bans proposed over the past decade in Florida have prompted breeders to gradually reduce their output. Not only will there be fewer new racing dogs going into the system, those currently racing likely won’t be replaced as they retire or become unable to continue racing. Goree recalls the final, mid-2016 night of live racing at Tucson Greyhound Park — Arizona’s last track to close before its statewide ban took effect last year. “When they announced that they were going to close, they had a little over 500 dogs on the backside,” Goree says. “The night they closed, they had 126 dogs, and within four days, we had those dogs moved out and into adoption. I will attribute that to teamwork between track management, greyhound adoption and regulatory authorities. Everyone worked together and did a fantastic job. I see no reason why that won’t happen in Florida.” Goree notes that GPA plans to work with regulatory officials in Florida to assure “an accurate count of every dog and an accounting of where each dog goes.” Meanwhile, foster and adoption applications are pouring into greyhound adoption organizations nationwide and insiders predict that qualified applicants likely will outnumber available dogs throughout the post-vote effort. “There is no dire emergency. None of these dogs are in danger,” says McKeon, who asserts that, despite the public contention, “Every adoption group wants to help the dogs, whether they’re anti-racing activists, whether they’re pro-racing or whether they’re non-activists. They’re all good people with the best intentions.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

TheHidden Figuresstar, 46, headed to Harvard University on Thursday to receive the 2017 Hasty Pudding Award from theHasty Pudding Theatricals, the university’s prominent theater group. Spencer was paraded through the streets of Cambridge, accompanied by Harvard students in drag, then feted at a no-holds-barred roast by the theater company. While the actors poked fun at her various movie roles, and got her to sing a duet to the James Brown song “I Feel Good,” the highlight of the roast came when she was asked to channel her character from 2011’s “The Help’’ — for which she won an Oscar — and feed one of three characters on stage a mock poop pie. She chose to feed it to an actor portraying Donald Trump’s key counselor, Kellyanne Conway. When asked after the ceremony why she chose Conway’s character — to whom she was coaxed to say “Kellyanne Conway, eat my s—,” — Spencer said. “It was in the moment.” “We have a new president, and I’m waiting for him to demonstrate that he will be president of all of us of these United States, so in that moment of levity, I enjoyed giving her the pie,” Spencer, 46, said candidly. “She’s a woman and she needs to understand why women are speaking out in fear of some of the rights we’ve already litigated being revisited.” Answering a question about legendary actress Mary Tyler Moore, who died Wednesday, Spencer said she “changed the face of how we view women and how we view independent women.” “It’s definitely a loss for the entertainment community, as well as the public at large, because she shaped a generation of independence and she will definitely be missed,” she said. And what advice would she give to young, African-American women who want to become actors? “It’s a long haul. It took me 15 years to become an overnight success,” Spencer said. “Know that you have to buy a good pair of sneakers and train. If you stay in the game long enough, you will win. You will win a race.” While she loves acting, Spencer said Thursday that her “dream role” would be that of a producer. “[I’d like to be] a woman behind the scenes who creates roles for diversity in film; and when I say diversity, I mean I want to see women of all shapes and sizes,” Spencer said. “It’s about creating a landscape that demonstrates what our society is as a whole. Homogeneity is not conducive to what we see around us, so my job as a producer is to have inclusion.” When congratulated on her second Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actress, Spencer was gracious, saying “thank you,” but adding, “I’m not going to win. Viola Davis is going to win.” In addition to Spencer and Davis, the Best Supporting Actress contenders are Namoie Harris for “Moonlight,” Nicole Kidman for “Lion,” and Michelle Williams for “Manchester by the Sea.” Spencer, who was the 67th recipient of Harvard’s Woman of the Year pudding pot, said she is going to put the trophy on a shelf with its “cousins,” her other acting trophies.

A spokesperson for the royal family declined comment to PEOPLE. Markle appears to think highly of Trump, having written about her admiration for the mother of threeon her blog The Tig back in 2014. “Staggeringly beautiful, no question, but so incredibly savvy and intelligent that she’s not just carved a niche for herself under her father’s famed Trump notoriety, she has undoubtedly created her own empire,” Markle wrote in the blog post, which also included an email interview with the businesswoman. “It’s so easy to knock the girls who come from privilege – to assume they rested on their laurels and garnered accolades simply by being fancy from the womb. But I always remember Ivanka being different – she wasn’t dancing on tables as a teenager or releasing pop albums,” Markle added. “She wasn’t running amok publicly, swearing and being smacked with DUIs. Instead she was graduating from The Wharton School (cum laude, I might add), launching the Trump Hotel Collection, and building her own brand.” Her piece included a vow that she would get together for drinks with Trump the next time she was in New York. “This much I know  – when we have drinks, I will make sure I order whatever she does – because this woman seems to have the formula for success (and happiness) down pat,” Markle said. It seems Markle’s admiration does not extend to Ivanka Trump’s father.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Brendan Fraseris the latest actor to come forward with his story of sexual assault in the wake of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. In a new interview withGQpublished on Thursday, theMummystar, 49, claims that former Hollywood Foreign Press Association (the non-profit organization that votes for the Golden Globe awards) president Philip Berk sexually assaulted him in the summer of 2003, while at a luncheon at the Beverly Hills Hotel — an alleged incident Berk disputes. The actor says he believes he was blacklisted in Hollywood partly due to the aftermath of the alleged incident. According to Fraser, the assault happened when Berk reached out to shake Fraser’s hand on his way out of the hotel. “His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around,” Fraser claimed. The alleged incident left Fraser overcome with panic and fear. “I felt ill,” he said, recalling his emotions after he removed Berk’s hand. “I felt like a little kid. I felt like there was a ball in my throat. I thought I was going to cry. I felt like someone had thrown invisible paint on me.” Though he told his wife, Afton, about what had happened at the time, Fraser toldGQ‘s Zach Baron that he didn’t have “the courage to speak up” earlier, “for risk of humiliation, or damage to my career.” “I didn’t want to contend with how that made me feel, or it becoming part of my narrative,” he added. He did have his reps ask the HFPA for a written apology, tellingGQthat the HFPA agreed they would never allow Berk in a room with Fraser again. (Reps for Fraser and the HFPA did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment). Berk, who is still a member of the HFPA, also did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment buthas denied the assault ever happened toThe New York Times. “Mr. Fraser’s version is a total fabrication,” he also said in a statement toGQ,acknowledging that he wrote a letter to Fraser about the alleged incident. “My apology admitted no wrongdoing, the usual ‘If I’ve done anything that upset Mr. Fraser, it was not intended and I apologize.’” In his 2014 memoirWith Signs and Wonders: My Journey from Darkest Africa to the Bright Lights of Hollywood, Berk recounted the incident too — saying he pinched Frasier’s ass “in jest.” RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement While other factors contributed to the downward momentum of his career, Fraser tells GQ that his alleged experience with Berk “made [him] retreat” and “feel reclusive.” “[I] became depressed,” he said, recounting how he told himself he deserved what happened to him. “I was blaming myself and I was miserable — because I was saying, ‘This is nothing; this guy reached around and he copped a feel,'” Fraser recalled. “[Work] withered on the vine for me. In my mind, at least, something had been taken away from me.” Fraser also wondered if the HFPA had blacklisted him. “I don’t know if this curried disfavor with the group, with the HFPA. But the silence was deafening,” he said, adding that he was rarely invited back to the Globes after 2003. (Berk denies that the HFPA retaliated against Fraser, tellingGQ, “His career declined through no fault of ours”). Even after speaking about his allegations, Fraser still feels uneasy. “Am I still frightened? Absolutely,” he says. “Do I feel like I need to say something? Absolutely.

I will be proven right.’” Obamaandformer Obama Administration officialshave denied that any such surveillance on Trump took place. Trump’s allegations, for which he offered no evidence, came in the form of Saturday morning tweets. Some have suggested the president wasreacting to conservative news reportsthat said the Obama Administration had conducted surveillance on Trump. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called the reports “troubling” in a statement on Sunday, saying the President wants the Congressional investigation into Russia’s interference in the election to also include a probe into his claims. “President Trump is requesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the Congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016,” Spicer said. Democrats have dismissed the President’s allegations as an attempt to deflect from negative attention over growing reports of contact between Trump allies and Russian officials during the campaign.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: One man who lives in Puerto Rico is proving the power of networking can go a long way when it comes to helping those in need. Alex Ruiz was making his way home to Ponce, Puerto Rico, on Sept. 19 when his flight out of Panama was canceled due toHurricane Maria. The 34-year-old, who was born in Bronx, New York, to hard-working Puerto Rican parents, is the Chief Strategy Officer ofPonce Health Sciences University. He had been traveling throughout South America for work and was eager to get back to his friends, employees and his younger brother, Emil Ruiz, 31, before the storm made landfall. “I knew I was going to be stranded, but I didn’t know for how long,” Ruiz tells PEOPLE. “Then the next day, Maria hit and that was the last time I had contact with my brother and over 600 of our employees and 1,000 students.” Ruiz, who moved to Ponce in May 2015 to work for the private, for-profit university, says he felt helpless in his hotel room in Panama as he watched the horror of the storm unfold on TV. “The first thing I did was just cry. I was watching the news and I couldn’t get in touch with my brother. My mom in New York was asking what was happening — we have a close-knit family,” he says. “I couldn’t watch the news anymore, it was the most depressing thing I had ever seen.” So he turned that feeling of helplessness into action, immediately calling on as many contacts and connections as he could. “I believe your network is extremely influential, so I started making calls and getting assistance from friends,” he says. “First, I started calling wealthy friends I knew asking if I could get a private jet.” When those logistics didn’t pan out, he started networking and eventually got through to San Juan, reaching someone at the Governor’s Office who was leading donations. Then he got a call from Warren Ross, president of the University of Medicine and Health Sciences, St. Kitts, who told him he could get a plane filled with doctors out of Chicago if Ruiz could help get it into Ponce. Ruiz immediately replied: “Of course, give me 48 hours!” From there, he got on the phone with Cathy Peng from Johns Hopkins University, who was able to check the status of a nearby airport in Ponce, where she is based. “I told her I had a plane with four doctors on it, and she found out that we could land it at Mercedita Airport in Ponce,” Ruiz says. The first plane landed last week and the doctors set out into the community to provide necessary aid. “The close-knit community of Ponce became the catalyst for all these things getting into motion,” Ruiz says of the community effort he has experienced in the aftermath of the storm. When Ruiz was finally able to get in touch with his university via a landline, he got to hear his brother’s voice for the first time in eight days. “I knew he was going to be okay, but it was so good to hear his voice,” Ruiz says. Then he got in contact with the Hispanic Federation in New York, who worked with the Florida DNC to organize two planes to fly out of Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday. A group of eight Florida Democratic state lawmakers wanted to see firsthand what the island was going through and deliver aid, and Ruiz said he could make a flight into Ponce happen — only this time he asked if he could have a seat on the plane, too. “I went to Walmart and tried to pack a lot of provisions for my brother and for a very special 4-year-old named Camila on the island. Kenira Thompson, the president of Ponce Research Institute, has a young daughter and she asked me to bring her chocolate milk. So I brought her chocolate milk and animal cookies in a floral backpack!” Ruiz says. When the plane landed, they were greeted by Ponce Mayor Mayita Meléndez. “The mayor comes out and starts running towards us and says, ‘Thank you for everything. We need all the help we can get because I have nothing.’ ” “The politicians were then able to go to more remote areas and see the devastation,” Ruiz adds. “They saw a lot of hurt on the island and have since moved into action.” As for Ruiz, he went straight to the university, where he saw the damage that had been done to the school, including a brand new $1.3 million neuroscience lab that had been destroyed in the storm. “I knew that things were going to be difficult, but I was heartbroken,” Ruiz says. Ruiz decided he could have more of an impact organizing efforts out of Florida, so he is now stationed in Miami, where he is working on getting other planes with aid and resources into Ponce. And the planes are not only bringing resources in, they are taking people in need out. Five Puerto Ricans with health problems, including a man who had just had triple bypass surgery and another heart patient, all traveled back to Fort Lauderdale with Ruiz on Tuesday. “I know I can be more effective stateside,” Ruiz says. “But I want to get back there as soon as possible. I’m just here to help an island I love that has been very good to me.” He adds: “I want to get the word out there because Puerto Rico is in trouble.” For ways to help victims of the storm,here are some verified organizationsassisting in the efforts.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

I think they were not factual.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: As soon asJohn Fettermansuffered a stroke on the campaign trail for U.S. Senate last May, he told his family and his staff that he would be going public with the news. With mere days left till the primary election and an even tougher general election ahead if he were to advance, hetweeted from the hospitaland explained the situation, aware that it could cost him necessary votes. In the year that's followed, Fetterman has navigated a difficult stroke recovery, an onslaught of ableist attacks, and one of the most expensive Senate races in history to ultimately flip one of Pennsylvania's seats blue. He also, in an unusually public manner for a politician,admitted himself to the hospitalfor a severe case of depression — just one month after being sworn in to Congress. Shortly after returning home from a 44-day stay in Walter Reed Medical Center's neuropsychiatry unit, Fetterman graciously welcomes PEOPLE into his Braddock, Pennsylvania, home. It's the first time the freshman senator and his wife,Gisele Barreto Fetterman, are speaking with the media since he was discharged, and one of the first real conversations they are publicly having about his mental health. Feeling in many ways transformed, Fetterman, 53, sits down on the couch in his signature Carhartt hoodie and basketball shorts, leans forward and inhales. He's ready to talk. For years Fetterman handled depression like many people do — that is to say he didn't pay it much attention, accepting as a young man that feeling low was an insoluble element of his personality. \"I always treated my depression like I did with losing my hair,\" he says. \"It's just kind of like, 'Oh yeah, that's just part of my makeup.'\" It was Gisele, 41, who broached the subject of mental health with her husband in the early years of their marriage, suggesting that he was displaying signs of depression. Fetterman was the rather successful mayor of Braddock at the time — beginning to earn national attention thanks to his big dreams for the small industrial town — and he remembers pushing back on the idea that he had a diagnosable issue, rebutting,I'm just a little melancholic. Maybe a little blue. \"I never thought that it was significant enough to go get help,\" he recalls. \"And I, of course, regret that I did not do that.\" Gisele learned in time that she didn't hold the power to fix Fetterman's mental health, but it was a process to adopt that mentality. \"In the beginning of our relationship, it was like, 'Why is he so sad all the time? I'm amazing!'\" she says. \"I think that's what people do: They blame themselves, but the reality is not one person should be who makes someone better. We should not carry that weight and the responsibility.\" A big part of that realization came from Gisele's own research, which she says began 12 years ago. \"I read every book on depression,\" she says, \"and I tried to get him to read those books.\" He didn't, back then, and she didn't force him. \"You could do everything to support someone, but you can't get them through the door,\" she says. \"He had to do that hard part himself.\" Fetterman, who served as mayor of Braddock for 13 years, eventually began looking to heighten his impact. He was elected as Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor in 2018, defeating the incumbent Democrat in a primary election to get on the gubernatorial ticket. In early 2021, a few months after Republican Sen. Pat Toomey announced his intention to retire, Fetterman declared candidacy for United States Senate, intent on filling the vacant seat. Fetterman and Gisele knew that the Senate campaign would not be easy, or kind. (As the second lady of Pennsylvania, Gisele — who was born in Brazil — made headlines for opening up about a racially charged verbal assault, when a woman who recognized her as Fetterman's wifespewed a racial slurat her outside of their local grocery store.) Fetterman's team decided to approach the Senate campaign with the second family's signature lightheartedness, routinelygoing viralfor highlighting the weaknesses of his opponent, celebrity doctorMehmet Oz, in clever and outlandish ways. \"[It was] about trying to be funny and help people realize that you don't actually have to be quite so ugly,\" Fetterman recalls of the campaign strategy. Polling long suggested that Fetterman was favored to defeat Oz,even as he spoke candidlyabout some of the restraints he was facing amid his stroke recovery. Then funding began pouring into Oz's campaign as Election Day neared to give Republicans a fighting chance at retaining the seat. That's when things started \"getting really, really ugly,\" Fetterman says, equating the attacks to having \"a $100 million blow torch turned on you.\" The attacks cut deep for him and his family, targeting his health and fitness to serve in Congress, and opened a door for media and the public at large to do the same, often veering into ableist territory by failing to acknowledge that the lingering side effects of his stroke would not prevent him from making the important decisions a senator is tasked with. One insult he heard on multiple occasions still appears painful for him to repeat: being called a \"vegetable.\" \"These kinds of personal things accelerated the depression,\" he says, though it wasn't until the nationally televised debate with Oz that something \"seismic\" shifted in his mental health. \"I'll never forget the date. It was October 25,\" Fetterman says, of course referring to the debate that came on the heels of vicious attacks on his mental fitness and a late surge in polls for Oz. \"I knew going into this debate that millions of people were going to be watching. And it wasn't even just for Pennsylvanians watching, this would be kind of national ... [it] would be living in history.\" Fetterman and his team prepared, prepared and prepared some more, understanding that any misspeak or visible struggle would be picked apart. \"But I was still in recovery from the stroke,\" he reminds. \"It would be trying to run a marathon with a broken ankle.\" Reviews of his performance on the debate stage included words like \"disaster,\" he remembers. \"I don't have any regrets because I believe that I had a responsibility to do the debate, but after that point, to me, that was where the depression really started to set in.\" By election night, polls suggested that the race could go either way, and when hesecured the victoryin the wee hours of the morning, he says he felt relieved that he didn't let his supporters down. But standing at a podium with fans cheering his name and his family by his side, he wasn't happy. \"After he won, you expect someone to be at their highest and really happy and celebratory,\" Gisele says. \"And after winning, he seemed to be at the lowest. That was, for me, the moment of concern.\" With cameras finally turned away after the election wrapped, Fetterman sank into his lowest place, rarely leaving bed. \"I literally stopped eating and drinking and I wasn't functional,\" he says, noting that he also began missing doses of his heart medication, which was important for his health after the stroke. Through tears, he adds: \"There wasn't one person in my life that said, 'Yeah, you really seem great. You sound fine here.'\" Not even his children. \"When an eight year-old can realize that something's really wrong...\" Arriving on Capitol Hill for his swearing in felt a chore, but he had no choice. Even the excitement of a new job didn't wake him up. \"My depression was in full force,\" he says, and he was starting to accept that he could not keep living that way. \"The conversation I had with my team and my family is that I've got to do something or it could end in the most awful way,\" Fetterman says, remembering his decision to admit himself to the hospital. Asked if he's referring to self-harm, he says: \"I realized that that could be an option. I wasn't thinking about self-harm, but I was firmly indifferent to living.\" \"There wasn't one single that in my life was letting me know that, 'John, you're doing all right.' And at that point I realized that there's no good possible outcome. And if I would harm myself, the damage would really be on my family,\" he says. \"I decided that I had one chance to address this.\" It's rare for a politician to discuss their mental health in the present tense, especially a newly elected U.S. senator whose campaign was already overshadowed by health concerns. But at the point that Fetterman was finally ready to seek treatment — after a lifetime of denying it — his family and team mobilized behind him, ready to set an example for just how far transparency can go. On Feb. 16, Fetterman stunned the nation when a statement from his spokesperson announced that the senator had voluntarily chosen inpatient treatment for clinical depression, a condition that the world was learning he had in live time with some of his loved ones. \"I took a sigh of relief,\" Gisele says of the moment he checked himself in. \"I was really happy.\" She continues: \"I think we always read in the news about when someone has done something terrible and tragic, and I would love to read more stories about someone saying, 'Hey, I just checked myself in to get help,' instead of the opposite.\" He checked in on his oldest son's 14th birthday, making the emotional decision to forgo a scheduled birthday dinner knowing that it would inflict less pain on him in the long run than the alternative of a father suffering. Fetterman spent more than six weeks in the neuropsychiatry unit, undergoing daily talk therapy, testing out different medications, exercising and learning to understand what was happening in his brain so that he could better withstand his feelings. He also finally read one of the books on depression that Gisele had been recommending. Fetterman received daily visits from his chief of staff to discuss legislation, and additional visits from colleagues and relatives. Gisele traveled to Maryland once a week to see him. \"One of the visits, all of the kids came,\" he says — Karl, 14, Grace, 11, and August, 9. \"And at that point, I was a little nervous.Am I okay? Am I still dad?Because I was wondering how they see me differently.\" The kids, unprompted, found a pile of Post-It notes in his room and used them all up, writing encouraging notes that said things like,Happy you are getting happier, andI am so proud of you, andYou will get better, andYou are any dad I could ask for. They plastered them on the wall across from his bed. \"I got so emotional,\" he recalls, because the notes reassured him that they wanted him to be right where he was.I'm still okay,I'm still your dad,he thought. He was already feeling changed, and now he had been given permission to take whatever time he needed to complete the transformation. For more from Sen. John Fetterman's emotional sit-down with PEOPLE,subscribe now to the magazineor pick up this week's issue, on newsstands Friday. \"One of the happiest days of my life was when [my doctor] said to me in one of the sessions, 'I believe that your depression is in remission,'\" Fetterman says. \"At that moment, I thought [for the first time that] there was a chance I was going to be able to be fully back with my family, that I was going to be back to being a senator and serve the people of Pennsylvania and my constituents. I mean ... that really, that was such a turn.\" He says he decided to leave Walter Reed on March 31 when he felt, for the first time, like life was a joyful thing, not just \"back to bearable\" like it had been before. \"When I first checked in, I never thought I would be where I'm at here,\" he says. \"To be joyous and to be feeling free of depression ... and to be free of pain, man, it's...\" Fetterman struggles to find the words to complete his thought, so Gisele jumps in: \"It's a first.\" Now, the once-skeptical senator is on a mission to get others to address their feelings, even if they haven't reached a breaking point yet. \"I don't care if you're a liberal or conservative, Republican or Democrat, we all can be depressed —and we all can get made healthier,\" he says. \"Go to the doctor or whoever you're able to. Address your depression. I was skeptical it would make anything better, but it did. It works. And I'm so grateful.\" If you or someone you know needs mental health help, text \"STRENGTH\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected to a certified crisis counselor.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

Stoner revisits her career as a child star and reflects on howHollywood can work to change the worst aspects of growing up in the spotlight. Name something comparable to the pop culture phenomenon of child stardom. As someone whose professional career initially spiked at 11 years old and whose face is now the cover of clickbait articles titled \"10 Shocking Ways These Child Stars Died,\" it's been a harrowing 80 years. I'm only 27. While traversing extreme peaks and valleys of global fame, hidden medical hospitalizations, artistic milestones, rapid adultification, and multi-layered abuse I wish on no one, I narrowly survived the toddler-to-trainwreck pipeline. In fact, nothing was designed for me to end up… \"Normal.\" \"Stable.\" \"Alive.\" RELATED:Alyson Stoner Reveals She Sought Treatment for Eating Disorders: It Was 'One of the Best Choices' The toddler-to-trainwreck pipeline is a notorious and thriving industrial complex around child entertainers. It was first documented in 1885 when Elsie Leslie made her theatrical debut at 4 years old, becoming an American celebrity at 6. Since then, a full-fledged system has emerged. It is expertly constructed and bolted in place by censoring the harm happening behind the scenes, manicuring aspirational lifestyles and outcomes, and then watching young lives tragically implode. You may recognize the pipeline by specific press campaigns (see \"shocking rebellion\" or \"miraculous comeback\"). It prophesies pitiful and shameful fates for little tots with big talent, while conveniently remaining in denial of its own violent blueprint. Instead, the damage manifests as illness or questionable behavior and gets projected onto the child as if they are an isolated problem. This does not dismiss their personal responsibility or negate the positives and privileges that accompany the spotlight. Simply, the records are consistent. How can children unwittingly copy and paste the same horror stories, cries for help, and humiliating spirals? How come there have been no signs of improvement for centuries? As someone who lived it and witnessed thousands endure alongside me, I can attest that what is missing from the pipeline narrative are clear action plans for intervention, long-term prevention, and accountability from studios, agencies, and guardians. On behalf of the current children being abused right now, there is an opportunity for us to empower each other through honest conversation and collaborative action. RELATED GALLERY:15 Former Child Stars on the Ups & Downs of Growing Up in the Spotlight I invite you to revisit this script with a broader lens. FIRST ACT Scene I: The Audition Room At 6 years old, I enter a sterile white room where a stranger stands apathetically behind a camcorder on a tripod. On cue, I perform the scene. This morning, I'm being kidnapped and raped. Ending in the fetal position under a chair with my body frozen in fear, I stand up, wipe my tears and thank the stranger for the opportunity. I walk to the car ruminating over my performance, comparing my screams to the other kids' I heard from the waiting room. As with many parents in this unusual situation, my mother is not versed in how to help me regulate my nervous system. I remain catatonic on the first half of the drive, until I remember we're en route to a second audition for a princess toy ad. On the spot, I manually alter my mood, personality and outfit so I can win over a new stranger with a camcorder. I need to outperform 900 other candidates. Suddenly, I'm \"Smiling Girl #437.\" These visceral portrayals of scenarios etch themselves into my bodymemory and compound with trauma occurring in real life behind closed doors. Additionally, there is an alarming dissonance about being coached to offer my 6-year-old self vulnerably to unfamiliar adults who have power over my well-being and future livelihood. RELATED:Matilda Star Mara Wilson Recalls Being 'Sexualized' as a Child Actress: 'I Felt Ashamed' My methodically rehearsed helplessness during the first audition will either be associated with rejection (not getting the role), or I will berewardedby booking the gig. To clarify, I'll be paid to recreate kidnapping and rape repeatedly on set with a crew of more strangers. If I'm especially believable, I may even get an Oscar and the praise of America. Let's contextualize this. Developmentally, my perceptions of basic safety, healthy relational attachment, and awareness of my environment are highly impressionable. Cognitively, I'm just beginning to comprehend the difference between the real and the imaginary. And my nervous system is imprinting patterns that will unconsciously dictate my behavior personally, socially and professionally for decades to come. WHAT CAN WE DO?One immediate solution is having a qualified, third-party mental health professional on every set, especially if minors are present. Think \"school counselor\" or \"sports psychologist.\" They can help monitor working conditions and be available to assist entertainers in regulating, shifting between identities and discharging residual inner turbulence after emotional performances. They can provide a safe space for people to anonymously report misconduct, harassment and mental health struggles. Trust me, the cost of one mental health practitioner is far cheaper than the existing \"damage control\" funds. Scene II: Child Labor Laws I am 12. I am a machine. I'm currently contractually obligated to complete multiple overlapping projects. I'm President of a corporation with salaried family members and multi-vertical teams. Revenue models for billion dollar media empires revolve around my peers' and my faces, talents and labor. While some companies stay within the legal range of working hours for minors, many do not. Regardless, set conditions are inappropriate and hazardous. Did you know that according to the U.S. Department of Labor, 17 states still don't have any regulations in place for child entertainment in 2021? Yet, all 50 have working child performers. RELATED:She 'Can't Be Tamed': The Evolution of Miley Cyrus, from Child Star to Music Icon Adding to this, zero productions acknowledge that after their shoot, I will go to another, record an interview during my lunch break, train for multiple hours, skip dinner, and meet for a late-night rehearsal. After all, their responsibility is to deliver a product on time and in-budget, not to babysit. Meanwhile, agents are encouraging me to look at early emancipation so I can worklongerhours. This will increase my hire-ability. My body is medically undernourished and chronically stressed, which later will evolve into severe eating disorders, adrenal fatigue and mandatory bedrest. The onset of puberty has turned my waist and bust into the main objects of attention and inspection. This will also categorize my career trajectory. I've learned that it is safer to dissociate in order to survive what my mind and body are subjected to daily. I'll be numb for another five years, but all you will see is the ever-highly-functioning, Smiling Girl #437. By now, I've missed months of schooling and my education is spotty at best. I am socialized to be \"on\" at all times, ranging from three dozen daily fan encounters, to grown reporters grilling me on my opinion of current events for which I'm not an expert, to avoiding any and all authentic friendships to protect confidential information. I try not to have an inflated sense of self, but even my church puts me on a pedestal.

WHAT CAN WE DO?Families and young people are not properly educated on the risks, pressures, consequences, and difficult processes and decisions ahead. Simultaneously, there aren't healthy standards or accountability from agencies and production companies. There needs to be mandatory Basic Industry and Media Literacy courses for guardians and representatives and to guide set protocols. This can act as a buffer to check the guardian's motives and level of preparedness. It can reveal negligent and greedy behavior within agencies. And it can establish the best practices for getting the million-dollar shot in the safest, most ethical manner. Scene III: The Boiling Point I'm 17. In just over a decade, the tentacles of the industry have suffocated and destroyed my family, every member with their own unique hardship. This whole dynamic can distort and exhaust even the healthiest of humans. Yet, each of us is forced to uphold a veneer, lest negative press reach our doorstep. The show truly never stops. Then it hits me. My childhood is officially gone. I can count on one hand how many times I've seen my father since I was little. My father had all three of his daughters ripped away from him and swallowed up by a system that would replace me in seconds. RELATED:Hailee Steinfeld on Child Stardom 10 Years After True Grit: Family Is 'Keeping Me Grounded' The grief, trauma and stress overtake me like a tsunami, and I admit myself to rehab against the guidance of my team. (They continue to send me auditions while I'm on bedrest.) I'm not here for drugs or alcohol. I'm here because I'mat least20 pounds underweight and I'm daring to believe that my health matters, even if it feels like I'm the only advocate for it. Unfortunately, I am reminded that taking this break risks losing momentum. Unless I have elite representation, millions of dollars and major networks pouring into a strategic debut into adulthood, my younger work will not amount to much in the eyes of \"serious\" film and television casting directors. After 200+ movies, shows, videos and tours, I'll need to start over, re-train, re-introduce myself. Culturally, I will be reduced to my past characters and expected to fade into a nostalgic memory or a \"has-been\", even though I haven't had a chance to learn who I am in the first place. I sign-in my name at the hospital, my body broken and my spirit shattered. A young girl battling her own health crisis finds a moment of relief, laughing at the television. I look at the screen. It's my face. SECOND ACT Maybe some have concluded that only unbalanced people are attracted to Hollywood, or you perceive this as claiming victimhood. This isn't about pointing fingers, but about working together to protect children who will be the next generation of society, many of whom have palpable influence over your own kids. Very few resources exist to help people unpack and navigate the implications of a child star-studded culture, whether you're the kid, the parent, the agent, or the audience. Solutions like mental health practitioners and Industry Literacy courses are easy next steps.

Though I'm not without scars and ongoing struggles, I amstillone of the most fortunatecases. I had access to a therapist who saw past the enchantment of fame and taught me to safely reinhabit my body. By some inner mysterious force I committed to deep self-work and constant healing as my rebellion. I dared to lose everything I'd worked for and walk away long enough to gain paradigm-shattering insight. These privileges are not equally available, distributed or even encouraged. The opposite is regularly enabled. And no. I didn't mention the sexual harassment, stolen IP and money, paparazzi, psychological impact of the new influencer landscape, toxic power plays, and whatactually happenedon all of those sets. If we disrupt and heal the toddler-to-trainwreck pipeline, we won't need another cautionary memoir. But, by highlighting my story as any form of \"exception\" to the rule, we misunderstand my peers' suffering, and we shift attention away from the changes needed immediately. I believe everyone deserves to feel safe, comfortable and confident in their mind and body, especially youth who are vulnerable with fewer tools to navigate daily life. No matter what has happened to you, there is a way to reconnect with yourself and reclaim your story, your voice, and your authority as your own. (This is why I work with licensed somatic psychotherapists at my company Movement Genius to help young people improve their mental and emotional well-being.) For the folks who click onWhere Are They Nowarticles, I am here. We are here. This is your first time reading my story, but it is our millionth time asking you to listen. So, I'll leave you with some questions for reflection: How might you as the audience or outside witness be connected to the toddler-to-trainwreck industrial complex? What are the risks of viewing these documentaries and headlines as entertainment without action? Something I have learned is that as long as we are enchanted or complacent, we're also vulnerable. This applies to families in Hollywood as well as consumers at home. Together, we can change the narrative.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: The suspect in astring of explosionsthatkilled two peopleand injured four others, terrorizing the area of Austin, Texas, for three weeks, was killed during a confrontation with police early Wednesday. Austin Police Chief Brian Manley announced in anews conferencethat authorities had zeroed in on the suspect and located him at a hotel in the town of Round Rock, north of Austin. While waiting for additional police support, the suspect drove away and eventually pulled over into a ditch, Manley said. “As members of the Austin Police Department SWAT team approached the vehicle, the suspect detonated a bomb inside the vehicle, knocking one our squad officers back and one of our squad officers fired at the suspect as well,” he said. Manley said that at no point did officials make contact with the suspect before the explosion. “The suspect is deceased and has significant injuries from a blast that occurred from detonating a bomb inside his vehicle,” he added. Manley did not name the suspect, pending positive identification and notification of next of kin, saying only that he was a 24-year-old white male. He said that a motive has not been confirmed and the investigation continues. It is not yet clear if the suspected bomber acted alone or with accomplices, Manley said. He declined to release other specific information about Wednesday’s altercation. Manley also urged residents of Austin and the surrounding communities to remain vigilant, as the suspect could have planted or mailed more bombs before his death. “This is the culmination of three very long weeks for our community,” he said.

More work needs to be done to ensure no more bombs had been sent before he died. The investigation continues to learn more information. Congratulations to the combined law enforcement effort.#AustinBombings#txlegehttps://t.co/ccCT6EMHx2 — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX)March 21, 2018 President Donald Trump reacted to the news on Twitter, writing early Wednesday, “AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD. Great job by law enforcement and all concerned!” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also praised the work of  Austin police and warned that residents exercise caution. “BIG NEWS. The Austin Bomber is dead. More work needs to be done to ensure no more bombs had been sent before he died. The investigation continues to learn more information,” Abbott said via Twitter. “Congratulations to the combined law enforcement effort.” On March 2, the first bomb detonated and killedAnthony House, a 39-year-old Austin resident who picked up the explosive device disguised as a package on his doorstep, authorities have said. The explosions continued on March 12, where 17-year-oldDraylen Masondied after picking up a package and another person, a middle-aged woman, was injured. Hours after that explosion occurred, police reported a third blast, which injured a 75-year-old Hispanic woman. Authorities soon announced a $115,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for those explosions — and shortly after, a fourth explosion,believed to be caused by a trip wire, occurred. Two men were injured. Afifth explosionwas reported on Tuesday, shortly after midnight, when a package believed to be bound for Austin exploded at a FedEx facility northeast of San Antonio. An employee at the facility was treated for ringing in her ears but no one was injured in the bombing. Anotherblast at a Goodwill in Austin, Texas,on Tuesday night was determined to have been caused by an incendiary device rather than a bomb. “At this time, we haveno reason to believe this incident is related to previous package bombs,” police said. A retired FBI criminal profiler,James R. Fitzgerald, previously told PEOPLE thesuspect appeared familiar with the area. “He’s not offending where he lives right now because it would be a little too close to home,” Fitzgerald said. “But he probably has familiarity with one or more of those areas.” Fitzgerald added, “These are sophisticated devices put together by someone who knows what he’s doing. He knew not just how to design it and place it, but how to travel with it too.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

On Monday’s episode of his SiriusXM show, Cuomo, 49, got candid about his battle with coronavirus, citing the experience as one reason for reassessing his career and position as a public figure. “I don’t want to spend my time doing things that I don’t think are valuable enough to me, personally. Like what? Well, I don’t like what I do, professionally, I’ve decided,” he said. “I don’t think it’s worth my time.” “I’m basically being perceived as successful in a system that I don’t value,” he continued. “I’m seen as being good at being on TV and advocating for different positions … but I don’t know if I value those things, certainly not as much as I value being able to live my life on my own terms.” Citing an incident from this past weekend when a stranger on a motorcycle allegedly confronted him outside his home, Cuomo said he wished he could have told the biker to “go to hell.” “That matters to me more than making millions of dollars a year … because I’ve saved my money and I don’t need it anymore,” he said. “I want to be able to tell you to go to hell, to shut your mouth … I don’t get that doing what I do for a living.” “I have to tolerate people’s opinion about me because I’m a public figure,” he continued. “I don’t want to do that, I don’t think it’s worth it to me.” Cuomo continued, explaining that he doesn’t want to spend his time “trafficking in things that I think are ridiculous,” including “talking to Democrats about things that I don’t really believe they mean” or “talking to republicans about them parroting things they feel they have to say.” RELATED: Chris Cuomo Says He’s ‘Sick of Being Sick’ as Wife Opens Up About His Coronavirus Battle Cuomo later walked back his comments about his career on Tuesday’s episode of his radio show, explaining, “I love where I am.” “I’ve never been in a better position professionally, I’ve never been more grateful, I’ve never been on a better team,” he added. “I love where I am. I love the position that I’ve been given. And I love who I’m doing it with,” he said. Cuomo also explained he was talking about changing how to do the job, in regards to his work on CNN. “It is frustrating to do this job in an environment where are people are not interested and open,” he added. “It is hard to practice journalism when people are so intent on believing what they want to believe for political advantage.

InBetrayal: The Final Act of the Trump Show(excerpted byPolitico), author and ABC News Chief Washington CorrespondentJonathan Karlwrites that the Senate minority leader, 79, sought to disinvite Trump, 75, from his successor's inauguration as McConnell \"felt he could not give Trump another opportunity to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power.\" Karl further writes that McConnell even wanted the four congressional leaders to pen a letter to Trump making clear he wasn't welcome, though that idea was squashed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who felt Trump's attendance at the inaugural ceremonies would project a \"message of unity\" to the American people. While McConnell was seemingly angered by Trump's actions in his final weeks in office, including his role in the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol, he ultimately did not vote to convict Trump for inciting the riot after Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives. RELATED:Trump Was 'Done' with Republican Party Until Officials Said They'd Ruin a $100M Political Tool: Book Karl's book, out Tuesday, further details the complicated relationship between Trump and McConnell, who was a major congressional ally but who grew increasingly estranged from Trump over his behavior. Nonetheless, McConnell has remained acutely aware of Trump's popularity with conservative voters. In the weeks following the riots, McConnell told fellow Republican Liz Cheney — who felt a committee should investigate what led to the attack — that she should move on from the riots, allegedly saying it could hurt her chances at reelection, Karl writes. Spokespeople for Trump and McConnell did not respond to PEOPLE's requests for comment regarding Karl's book. Elsewhere in his book, Karl writes that former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had discussions about using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office in the hours following the Capitol riots. Speaking on MSNBC on Monday, Karl said he \"learned that Mnuchin had several conversations about the 25th Amendment and, further, that Mike Pompeo actually asked for a legal analysis of the 25th Amendment and how it would work.\" Karl continued that the conversations ultimately fizzled, however: \"It quickly became apparent that the 25th amendment was not going to work,\" Karl said on MSNBC, as reported byMediaite. \"It would not be quick enough. It would be subject to legal challenges, et cetera.\" Neither Mnunchin nor Pompeo initially commented on his reporting about the 25th amendment, despite multiple requests, Karlsaid. A spokesperson for Pompeo later denied any conversation about the 25th Amendment.

Under the amendment, the president is not removed from office as he would be under impeachment.

One of those theories — that Obama wasn't born in the United States — came back to haunt him in infamous fashion, after Obama released his birth certificate and roasted Trump for his role in the so-called \"birther\" movement at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Association dinner. Chris Christiewas in the room where it happened. The former New Jersey governor writes in his new book,Republican Rescue: Saving the Party from Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden, about being in attendance at the April 30, 2011, event at the Washington Hilton. The dinner — traditionally an event in which the president offers good-hearted jabs at the journalists who cover him and other D.C. notables — was held just three days after Obama released his long-form birth certificate, a document Trump had repeatedly insisted didn't exist. That Trump himself was in the audience when Obama took the stage meant that the businessman was a prime target for much of the night's humor. It was a spotlight, according to observers, that Trump did not relish. \"I was right there when it happened,\" Christie, 59, writes. \"I had a clear view of the faces of the two combatants. I witnessed every brutal knife twist and every painful grimace.\" RELATED:Chris Christie Thought COVID Might Kill Him: What He Has to Say About His Future and His Old Friend Trump As Christie, now an ABC News contributor, notes in his book: \"It was a big room, but I had a prime ringside seat.

But no one is happier, no one prouder, to put this birth certificate to rest than the Donald. And that's because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter like, Did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?\" Christie writes that Obama was \"mocking the baseless charge by comparing it to the most discredited conspiracy theories and pinning it on its loudest voice. The whole room, 2,600 journalists and Washington power brokers, Republicans and Democrats alike, howled in laughter.\" The famously thin-skinned Trump, meanwhile, \"was staring straight ahead. He was rocking back and forth in his chair. He still didn't break a smile,\" according to Christie. The moment, Christie writes, \"was fascinating and excruciating all at once\" and Obama \"showed no mercy on Donald Trump.\" Christie continues: \"I can say this much: I spoke to Donald after the dinner. He was pissed off like I'd never seen him before. Just beside himself with fury.\" RELATED:Chris Christie Is Considering a 2024 Presidential Bid, Whether Trump Runs or Not: Report The merciless mocking of Trump that night would continue when comedian Seth Myers took the stage to say, among other things, \"Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican — which is surprising, since I just assumed that he was running as a joke.\" In the years since the 2011 dinner, some have speculated that the many jokes lobbed in Trump's direction that night ultimately led him torun for office. AsThe Washington Post'sRoxanne Robertswrote in April 2016, however: \"This narrative flies in the face of actual history: Trump mentioned running for president as far back as the 1980s, so the notion that this dinner was the single catalyst for this presidential campaign is absurd.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The 47-year-old first lady took a trip to Toronto, Canada, to meet with Harry on Saturday ahead of the Opening Ceremony for the third annual Invictus Games — the multi-sport international event Harry created specifically for wounded, injured, or sick armed services personnel. Wearing a black and white dogtooth Dior suit, Trump was all smiles as she shook hands with Harry and posed for photographers in the Yorkville East conference room of the local Sheraton hotel. The two then sat on cream-colored leather seats with the respective flags for each of their countries behind them and a white orchid sitting on a table between them, briefly chatting in front of pool reporters. “Thank you. Thank you so much for coming,” Harry, who wore a navy suit with a crisp white shirt and maroon tie, told the first lady. Trump is leading a U.S. delegation to the Paralympic-style games. Her trip to the event is her first solo trip out of the country since her husband assumed the presidency in January.

After shaking hands at the meeting Saturday, Harry thanked him and described the reaction to Invictus Games in Canada as “absolutely amazing.” He said, “There’s a real buzz across Toronto — everyone’s getting into it.” Trudeau also thanked Harry and added that, “Sophie and I wish every competitor the best.” And as the press were summoned out, Harry put aside his airs and graces and leant in to whisper Trudeau a joke — which made him loudly splutter with laughter. The duo had a clear rapport when Harry flew out to promote the games in Toronto last year.  They were seen laughing and smiling as they watched a demo ice hockey game together. Meghan Markle is also an acquaintance of the 45-year-old prime minister.

The pair had been chatting together on a sofa at the One Young World summit in Ottawa. Meghan is also friends with his wife, Lady Sophie Gregoire Trudeau – and has reportedly taken her advice on how to deal with fame. The pair even attended a party together at the Toronto Soho House last year. Harry launched the Invictus Games in 2014. The title comes from the Latin word Invictus, meaning unconquered or undefeated. “These guys do not want sympathy,”Harry told PEOPLE exclusively in 2016. “They view it as an opportunity to put on a show for all those people who have supported them.” The games are similar to the U.S. Warrior Games, which was created in 2010 by the United States Department of Defense. Harry says he was inspired to create his own event after seeing a British team compete in the Warrior Games in 2013.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: When Helena Bonham Carter takes to the small screen to playPrincess Margaretin the third season ofThe Crown, she’ll be well prepared. The LondonEvening Standardnewspaper reported last week that Bonham Carter was “all but confirmed” to take on the role ofQueen Elizabeth’syounger, rebellious sister. (Olivia Colmanhas been announcedas taking over fromClaire Foyas the Queen.) And she’s certainly got the pedigree for the job: Bonham Carter not only played Margaret’s mom,Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Motherin the2010 movieThe King’s Speech, but her real-life grandmother was a great friend of the late Prime Minister Winston Churchill – a key character in the hit Netflix show’s first season. Bonham Carter — famous for her role as Bellatrix Lestrange in theHarry Potterseries, among other films – previously spoke with PEOPLE in 2011 about her royal role in the filmThe King’s Speech.She said that she spoke with royal expert Hugo Vickers to ready herself to play Margaret and Elizabeth’s mother, and sourced rare footage of the royal talking to help. “She had a rule that to be a public figure, never complain and never explain and never speak publicly,” Bonham Carter said in 2011. “That was why it was so hard to find her speaking so candidly. The only bit that I found was her talking about Castle of Mey [in Scotland] towards the end of her life.” RELATED: ‘The Crown’s’ Matt Smith Says He Wants Selena Gomez to Play Meghan Markle on the Show Bonham Carter believes the Queen Mother was “incredibly witty” and had a steely side to her character. “She developed it almost through necessity and almost through life experience,” she said. “Underneath she was always someone who knew her own mind and in comparison to him she had a very strong sense of self and a basic confidence that he lacked.” “She recognized that something had to be done [about the soon-to-be King’s speaking] and also out of sheer compassion and a wish to help someone she loved who was in such pain. She was an optimist also, whereas he was innately somewhat pessimist.” The Queen Mother had a way of both giving people something, but also holding back something her “own core self,” Bonham Carter believes. “She played very low status in some ways with the cocked head and humble,” she said of the consort. “But she also knew, ultimately, her position. She knew who she was!” The difficulty of a life in the public eye – captured so well in the first two seasons ofThe Crown– is not lost on the actress either. “I’ve always had respect for them as individuals,” she said. “I’ve never had any envy for that kind of life. The sheer amount of duty! You also don’t have too much personal freedom. It is a gift to know how to be a public figure.” Bonham Carter’sCrownlinks continue with her grandmother Violet, who was one of Churchill’s closest female friends. Violet was the daughter of former Prime Minister H.H. Asquith and was a formidable politician herself, serving as the President of the Liberal Party between 1945 and 1947.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: While the government does not consider the change a \"significant energy action,\" critics said it could spur waste and one advocate called on President-elect Joe Biden to reverse it The Department of Energy updated its regulations on Tuesday, allowing for more water to be dispensed in showers. The change follows PresidentDonald Trump’s well documentedcomplaints— serious or a little sarcastic — about low-water pressure rules ruining his “perfect” hair. Trump, 74, had repeated his gripes about showerheads, faucets and dishwashers throughout this year, both on the campaign trail and speaking from the presidential podium at the White House. \"So, showerheads,\" Trumpsaidin July. \"You take a shower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out. So, what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I don’t know about you — but it has to be perfect. Perfect.\" At least 40 U.S. states face a looming water crisis, according to a 2014 Government Accountability Officereport, which noted water shortages “are expected to continue into the future.” On Tuesday, the Department of Energy updated federal standards set back in 1992 to allow for more water to be used in a shower. The previous rule restricted showerheads to pumping out 2.5 gallons per minute at the maximum, and a 2013 Obama-era ruling had upheld that definition, no matter the amount of showerheads in a shower. However, the new Trump administration update to the regulation now says each showerhead can pump out 2.5 gallons of water, loosening federal conservation rules. RELATED:Trump and His 'Beautiful Head of Hair' Have Some Complaints About Showers, Lightbulbs and Dishwashers “One commenter stated that the proposal harms human health by wasting our most precious natural resource,” the Department of Energy’sown reportreads, noting backlash to its updated regulation. While some complaints noted that four out of five states face water shortages, other critics said the new rule will also “increase water and energy consumption and lead to higher utility bills for consumers.” In contrast to the concern over unnecessary wastefulness, the department noted supportive comments such as one which “stated that the inability of updated showerheads to allow more water during use is frustrating.” The department then concluded its new regulation “does nothing to alter the current energy conservation standard for showerheads and is therefore not a significant energy action.” RELATED:Trump Boasts of Putting 'a Lot More Water' in Dishwashers & Bringing Back 'Old-Fashioned' Bulbs The Natural Resources Defense Council responded, calling the new regulation “needless” and said the new federal rules “will waste water and energy.” “It’s ridiculous for the Department of Energy to call these ‘quality of life’ improvements when they’ll actually harm America’s quality of life by needlessly increasing consumer water and energy bills and climate-warming carbon pollution while exacerbating water shortages,” Noah Horowitz, the director of the Center for Energy Efficiency Standards at the NRDC, said in astatement. The NRDC said the new rules “also come at a time when areas of the country are increasingly subject to extended droughts and cannot afford to waste water through such unnecessary regulatory loopholes.” Andrew deLaski, the executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, called on President-electJoe Biden's incoming administration to immediately reverse the rule come 2021. “These last-minute Trump rules that allow for products that needlessly waste energy and water are ridiculous and out of step with the climate crisis and the long-term drought facing much of the country,” deLaski said in astatement. “The Biden administration can and should promptly reverse them.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Donald Trumpfaces another court case this week, this one hinging on allegations from formerElleadvice columnist and TV hostE. Jean Carroll, who has accused the former president of rape and defamation. Carroll, 79, filed suit against the now 76-year-old former president in New York, alleging battery and defamation under the state's Adult Survivors Act, which creates a one-year lookback window for survivors of sexual abuse to file claims otherwise barred by the statute of limitations. The journalist's case is now going to trial, with jury selection beginning in Manhattan on Tuesday. Carroll arrived at the courthouse Tuesday morning to the sound of supporters chanting \"We believe E. Jean Carroll.\" In her suit — filed on Thanksgiving Day 2022 in the U.S. Southern District of New York — the writer alleges: \"Roughly 27 years ago, playful banter at the luxury department store Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue in New York City took a dark turn when Defendant Donald J. Trump seized Plaintiff E. Jean Carroll, forced her up against a dressing room wall, pinned her in place with his shoulder, and raped her.\" The suit further alleges that Carroll \"remained silent for over two decades\" for fear of being buried in \"threats and lawsuits\" and damage to her reputation and livelihood. The suit claims that the incident \"severely injured Carroll, causing significant pain and suffering, lasting psychological harms, loss of dignity, and invasion of her privacy\" and seeks \"redress for her injuries and to demonstrate that even a man as powerful as Trump can be held accountable under the law.\" If Carroll wins the trial, it will be the first time Trump — who has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of women — is held legally responsible for sexual misconduct. In a statement to PEOPLE, Carroll's attorney Roberta Kaplan says the writer \"intends to hold Donald Trump accountable not only for defaming her, but also for sexually assaulting her, which he did years ago in a dressing room at Bergdorf Goodman.\" An attorney for Trump has told outlets including the Associated Press that the case is \"an abuse\" of the new law. \"While I respect and admire individuals that come forward, this case is unfortunately an abuse of the purpose of this Act which creates a terrible precedent and runs the risk of delegitimizing the credibility of actual victims,\" Trump attorney Alina Habba told the outlet. Trump has adamantly denied Carroll's claims of assault, saying ina 2019 interview: \"No. 1: She's not my type\" and, further, that he had \"never met this person in my life.\" (The two have been photographed together, though Trump said that was an incidental moment.) Trump also tweeted at the time that Carroll was \"totally lying\" about the rape, claiming she made up the allegation in order to help sell her memoir. Those comments ultimately spurred legal action from Carrollwho sued Trumpfor defamation in 2019, arguing that his claims caused her \"emotional pain and suffering\" and damaged \"her reputation, honor, and dignity\" and thus her career. That first suit remains at a standstill over disputes about whether the Department of Justice can defend the former president. This trial, however, is part of Carroll's second lawsuit, filed in November 2022 and alleging both battery and defamation. Never miss a story — sign up forPEOPLE's free daily newsletterto stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer. As the case goes to trial, some of the former president's accusers are set to take the witness stand following jury selection, which began Tuesday morning. The accusers include both Carroll herself as well as formerPEOPLE writer Natasha Stoynoff,who has previously alleged that Trump assaulted her while she was at Mar-a-Lago to interview him and his wife, a then-pregnantMelania Trump, for a story. Carroll's lawyers have said that Stoynoff and another women who has claimed Trump assaulted her — Jessica Leeds — will act as witnesses to bolster Carroll's account. In an in-depth reportreleased byThe New York Timesin 2016, Leeds — now in her 70s — charged that Trumpphysically violated heraboard a plane over 35 years ago. Friends of Carroll who are said to have heard her firsthand account as well as Bergdorf Goodman staffers will also reportedly take the stand, perNPR. Portions of Trump's own deposition in the case, which was taken privately and under oath, will likely also be made public as part of the trial. As the trial is taking place in federal court, it will not be televised — meaning the details from the case will come via reporters in the courtroom. NPR reports that the trial is expected to last roughly a week, and that \"damages could run to tens of millions of dollars\" if Trump is found to be at fault. Carroll is seeking unspecified damages and demanding that Trump issue a retraction of his earlier statements about her. The case comes on the heels of other legal issues for Trump, who in March became the first former president in U.S. history to answer to criminal charges, when he appeared in a Manhattan courtroom toplead not guilty to 34 felony countsof falsifying business records in the first degree following an investigation into an alleged hush money payment made to adult film starStormy Danielswhile he was a presidential candidate in 2016.

RELATED: What Nancy Pelosi Has to Say About Possibly Impeaching and Indicting President Trump An only-partial closure of national parks has also been causing controversy. While a government shutdown in 2013 closed all national parks completely, the Trump Administration opted to keep them open but largely unstaffed  — potentially creating unsafe conditions, the senior budget director at the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association, John Garder, told theTimes. “Keeping the parks open is clearly causing threats to health and safety of visitors as well as wildlife and natural and cultural resources,” Garder said. “We are worried about parks themselves, about park rangers who are demoralized and the many businesses that depend on visitors.” According to theNew York Daily News, some 80 percent of the National Park Agency’s workforce, which assures that facilities run safely and cleanly, has been furloughed in the shutdown. For example, trash collections, visitors’ centers and restrooms are all closed at California’s Yosemite National Park and as a result, officials taped off two campgrounds after finding human feces on the trails, according to theTimes. Something similar happened in Joshua Tree, further south outside Los Angeles, which had to bar camping starting on Wednesday because of near-capacity toilets,CNN reports. The website for Mount Rainier National Parkin Washington warns visitors that while the gates remain open, entry is at their “sole risk.” RELATED VIDEO: Michael Cohen Slams Trump in First Post-Sentencing Interview: ‘The Man Doesn’t Tell the Truth’ Meanwhile the elements have hindered access at other facilities, such as Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. TheDaily Newsreports a lack of plowing resulted in major road closures. What’s more, if the shutdown continues, snow is expected to lock the gates of even more parks that are currently open. Some parks, such as the Grand Canyon, have fully functioning restaurants and other services within, provided that they’re privately or state-owned. “Regardless of what happens in Washington, the Grand Canyon will not close on our watch,” Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey told theDaily News. “If you have plans to visit the Grand Canyon over the weekend, keep ’em. The Grand Canyon will remain open.” In addition to Arizona, a few states are paying out of their own pockets to keep tourist destinations open. TheTimesreports that New York is paying $65,000 so visitors can continue to peruse Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. Puerto Rico is providing up to $80,000 so the San Juan National Historic Site can function for two weeks. Visitors’ centers at Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks in Utah are also open. The shutdown is now in its 13th day with a path to imminent resolution unclear. Trump has been unwavering in his call for border wall funding — so far rejected by Congress. The incoming Democratic majority in the House has offered a fraction of Trump’s request.

The cases were isolated and statistically low — the condition, called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or CVST, occurred in just six people out of the more than 6.8 million who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — but the two health agencies asked for a pause to review data on the cases. \"These events appear to be extremely rare. However, COVID-19 vaccine safety is a top priority for the federal government and we take all reports of adverse events following vaccination very seriously,\" FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a press briefing on Tuesday. Here's what to know about CVST, and what to do if you've already received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. What is CVST? CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in part of the brain, preventing blood from moving through the brain,according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. The clotted blood cells can then break and bleed into the brain tissue, causing a hemorrhage or stroke. RELATED:Wondering About the Side Effects of the COVID Vaccine? Here's What to Know The FDA and CDC recommended the pause in Johnson & Johnson vaccinations in part to help physicians look for the warning signs of CVST, especially if their patient has recently received the vaccine. What are the symptoms? CVST symptoms differ fromthe typical side effects of a COVID-19 vaccine. They can include headache, blurred vision, fainting, seizure and coma. \"For people who recently got the vaccine within the last couple of weeks, they should be aware to look for any symptoms,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, the principal deputy director of the CDC, said at the briefing. \"If you received the vaccine and develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath, you should contact your health care provider and seek medical treatment.\" For people who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the last month, however, \"the risk to them is very low at this time,\" she said. What will the FDA and CDC do during this pause? The two agencies said they plan to look into the six cases to determine if they wererelated to the vaccinationsor coincidental. Dr. Peter Marks, the chief regulator of vaccines at the FDA, said that they were concerned because the \"pattern is very, very similar to what was seen in Europe with [the AstraZeneca] vaccine.\" \"So I think we have to take the time to make sure that we understand this complication and we address it properly.\" Woodcock said that they expect the pause to only last a \"matter of days,\" and Schuchat said they are \"committed to an expeditious review\" in the hopes of quickly resuming Johnson & Johnson vaccinations. Should I still get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine?

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: \"Be the first to be counted and vote early,\" one expert recommends More than 69 million votes have already been cast in the2020 presidential election, as thenovel coronavirus(COVID-19) pandemic and sky-high interest are driving numerous Americans toward the ballot box weeks before Election Day. The total votes cast as of Tuesday afternoon,according to data compiled bythe U.S. Elections Project, has already eclipsed the total number of early votes cast in 2016 and makes up about half the total votes cast that year. “It is so exciting!” Tammy Patrick, a senior adviser to the elections program at the bipartisan Democracy Fund Voice foundation, told PEOPLE. “We were hit by a global pandemic and many wondered, ‘What impact will this have on turnout?’ Many lessons were learned this spring that I believe are impacting the general election.” Indeed, as COVID-19 raised health concerns across the country, many election officials revised their plans, pushed for more voter options and expanded services like ballot tracking, prepaid postage, ballot drop boxes and use of sports arenas as polling locations. Plus, according to Patrick, “voters are taking early action and are flattening the curve by voting now” rather than bunching up in large Election Day lines. What is less clear is which candidate this enthusiasm might benefit, either PresidentDonald Trumpor Democratic nomineeJoe Biden. Numerous state and national polls have shown Biden with a durable lead. But the large wave of voters so far has raised questions about whether polling — a largely accurate but imperfect tool — has overlooked some group, particularly those who rarely or never turned voted before. RELATED:How, When and Where to Vote in the November Election The U.S. Elections Project's data shows that more than 46 million mail-in ballots have already been cast as of Tuesday — this despite Trump’s slew of false statements about voting by mail. In some states, however, the legislatures and the courts continue to wrangle over where and when to stop accepting and counting mail ballots, with the dates varying by state. Voting proponents say such restrictions are anti-democratic, though critics of expanded mail balloting argue it could create problems, even though experts say widespread mail fraud is not an issue. Early voting records haven’t just been shattered via mail, either.More than 23 million votes have also been cast in person as of Tuesday, according to the U.S. Elections Project, a bipartisan vote tracking database run by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald. For example, Maryland began early in-person voting with a record-setting day Monday: More than 161,000 residents waited in line to cast their votes, setting the state’s single-day early voting record. Nineteen-year-old resident Armon Wilson,toldThe Baltimore Sunhe woke up at 4 a.m. and walked an hour in the rain to be first in line Monday morning.“I’m here to show older people: younger people — we vote,” Wilson told the newspaper. “We’ve got to back up talk with action.” In Washington state, many voters have shown a similar determination while voting absentee amid the pandemic. The state holds its elections mostly by mail andreportedMonday that it has more than tripled its voter turnout thus far, with more than 2.25 million votes cast compared to less than 1 million at this time in 2016. RELATED:See Celebs' Voting Selfies for the 2020 Election McDonaldtold NPRthat states like Washington, who hold their elections completely via mail, have led the way for encouraging early voter participation. The professor told the outlet he estimates at least 150 million votes will be cast by Election Day, making for the highest turnout rate in more than a century. \"We continue to pile on votes at a record pace,\" McDonald told NPR. \"We've already passed any raw number of early votes in any prior election in U.S. history.\" Election officials warn that despite — and in some waysbecauseof — the historic surge in early voting, many states will not be able to report results of the presidential race on Nov. 3. It may take days, or weeks, to get clear results. But that doesn't automatically mean anything has gone wrong (despite repeated suggestions by President Trump). The country's election history includes many examples of races that took time to settle, particularly in states like California with a tradition of slow ballot-counting. Different states take different amounts of time to count their votes (The New York Timeshas a guideto the different timetables) and the final tallies are not legally certified for days or even weeks afterward. The Electoral College that technically elects the president, based on the state results, does not meet until mid December. While some states have laws allowing election officials to begin counting votes weeks ahead of the election — Arizona, Colorado and Florida, to name a few — many states don’t allow their officials to begin opening and counting up ballots until Election Day, or later. RELATED:How Celebs Are Helping Get Out the Vote for the 2020 Election In Michigan, the state's Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson warned as early as September that “election night” will look more like “Election Week,” because of its laws restricting officials to begin counting its millions of ballots until polls close on Nov. 3. \"If it takes a few extra days to ensure we have a full and accurate counting as a result of every race, that's what it's going to take,\" Benson previouslytoldNBC’sMeet the Press. \"We're going to be transparent throughout that whole process to make sure every citizen knows exactly where we are in the counting process and how many more ballots we have to get through.\" And Michigan isn't alone. At least 22 states, and Washington, D.C., allow ballots post-marked by Nov. 3 to be counted in the days following, according to theTimes. Eight states say they'll be able to report results by noon following Election Day, theTimesreports, while some states' officials — including in Alaska, Rhode Island and New York — have already said they won't release their results on election night. The major media organizations that have historically called the winner on election night, based on a mix of partial results and data inference, are expected to take a more cautious approach this year given the change in voting patterns. In some scenarios — say, if the key swing state Florida is decisively won by either candidate — a winner may be clear by the night of Nov. 3. In many other plausible situations, however, it may take longer. In order to be part of the count, either the night of Nov. 3 or in the days afterwards, election experts like Patrick advise people to vote as soon as possible. “You should know that if you still have your vote by mail or absentee ballot, [the Postal Service] recommends mailing it back one week before it is due — so, that should be mailed back immediately,” Patrick said. “In most states the early ballots are reported when the polls close on election night, so be the first to be counted and vote early.” Have questions about how to vote ahead of the Nov. 3 election?

Sarkozy, 66, was found guilty of trying to illegally obtain information from a judge about an ongoing investigation into his campaign finances. According toCNN, he was given a three-year sentence by a French court, but two of those years have been suspended. The judge said that Sarkozy could serve his sentence under house confinement, CNN reports. He would need to wear an electronic bracelet at home. According to theThe Washington Post, Sarkozy's attorney says they plan to appeal the sentence. According to the prosecution, Sarkozy and his attorney Thierry Herzog tried to bribe a federal magistrate, Gilbert Azibert, by offering him a high-profile position in return for information about an ongoing investigation into Sarkozy's campaign funds. The alleged bribe happened two years after Sarkozy had left office. The magistrate was presiding over a case that claimed Sarkozy and others had accepted illegal contributions from business executive Liliane Bettencourt in 2007.

Wade— a move that some have suggestedpaves a path to target same-sex relationships— many lawmakers are attempting to codify same-sex marriage rights at the federal level. Congress' attempt to protect Americans' marriage rights comesvia the Respect for Marriage Act, or RFMA, a bill that would repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which defined marriage as involving a man and woman and gave states the authority to refuse recognition of same-sex couples who had married. RELATED:What to Know About the 'Respect for Marriage Act' as D.C. Lawmakers Rush to Codify Same-Sex Marriage The Supreme Court deemed the primary provisions of DOMA unconstitutional in itsUnited States v. WindsorandObergefell v. Hodgesrulings. But DOMA still technically a law and, if those Supreme Court precedents were to be overturned by the current justices (which somehave expressed a willingnessto do), it could go back into effect. Earlier this week, the House passed RFMA in a 267-157 vote, with 47 Republican representatives joining Democrats in defending marriage equality. Now, RFMA heads to the Senate, where Democrats will need to get 10 Republican senators to side with them in order to meet the 60-vote threshold for passage. Some have already expressed disinterest in supporting the bill — including Florida Republican Marco Rubio, who told CNN reporter Manu Raju it was \"a stupid waste of time.\" But other Republicans have expressed an openness to supporting the bill. Here's what some of them have said. Republican Sen.Susan Collinshelped introduce the latest, bipartisan iteration of RFMA. In a statement shared with PEOPLE, she said: \"This bill is another step to promote equality, prevent discrimination, and protect the rights of all Americans.\" TheWashington Postreports that an aide to Rob Portman said the Ohio Sen. plans to co-sponsor the Senate bill and Portman himself told reporters Wednesday, \"I think it's the right policy, and I think it's the right message to send.\" Portman's son, Will, is openly gay, and wrote about his father's support in a coming-out story published inYale Newsin 2013. Portman told reportersthat same yearhis son helped shift his views on marriage equality: \"I think we should be allowing gay couples the joy and stability of marriage.\" Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski signaled a willingness to support the bill also, telling CNN that she has \"suggested to others that not only would I like to seeRoe,Casey, andGriswoldon contraception codified but I've also made clear my support ... for gay marriage years ago. So I will look at what the House is doing and see what that might mean here on the Senate side.\" North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis told CNN that he \"probably will\" support the legislation — not exactly a ringing endorsement, but more concrete than what some other Republicans have said. Wisconsin's Ron Johnson signaled both his support and his criticism for the bill in a statement in which he said he supported civil unions prior to the passage ofObergefell. \"AfterObergefell, I considered the issue settled,\" Johnson said in the statement, which was shared toTwitter by CNN's Raju. \"UnlikeRoe v. Wade, I do not see any scenario in which the Supreme Court would overturnObergefell.

Wade Is Overturned RELATED: President Biden Calls on Congress to End Filibuster and CodifyRoe v.

One bill, the Ensuring Women's Right to Reproductive Freedom Act — which passed 223-205 — would protect a patient's right to travel across state lines for abortion services. Another bill, the Women's Health Protection Act — which passed 219-210 — would allow healthcare workers the right to provide abortion services and patients the right to obtain them, regardless of several state bans. Though both pieces of legislation were passed by the Democrat-led House, the bills are unlikely to pass the Republican-led Senate. Earlier this month,President Joe Bidenalso signed an executive order vowing to \"ensure the safety of patients, providers, and third parties\" who have abortions or provide abortion services.

That's why, she said, she sent text messages to those close to Trump, urging them not to concede the election and to fully embrace the former president's claims of fraud, despite any evidence. Now, however, she regrets \"all of those texts,\" she told the committee. The committee earlier obtained 29 texts between Thomas, 65, and former White House Chief of StaffMark Meadows. In the messages, which were reported bythePostandCBS News, Thomas beseeched Meadows, 62, to do what he could to keep Trump in power, despite Biden's win. Three days after the election, for instance, Thomas wrote Meadows: \"Do not concede. It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back.\" Of her text messages with Meadows, Thomas said she now regrets \"the tone and content,\" saying, \"it was an emotional time, and I was texting with a friend who I had known a long time. So I really find my language imprudent and my choices of sending the context of these emails unfortunate.\" Thomas was also found to have written emails to at least 29 lawmakersin Arizona, pressing them \"to set aside Joe Biden's popular vote victory and 'choose' presidential electors.\" Emails obtained by the committee also showed thatThomas was in contactwith conservative attorneyJohn Eastman, a central figure in the investigation who had written a detailed plan to attempt to persuade then-Vice PresidentMike Penceto throw out the 2020 election results on Jan. 6. In a voluntary interview with the committee, Thomas said, \"there's a lot of people uncomfortable with the 2020 election despite what this committee is pushing\" — a remark that echoes the claims of the former president and his allies. Trump has claimed for more than two years that the election was fraudulent and somehow \"stolen\" from him. Those claims have been investigated by even Trump's own attorney general, who has since called them \"bulls---.\" Legal challenges to the election have failed in states across the country. But Thomas told the committee she \"wouldn't have believed\" that people like Barr \"were able to identify and track down\" the same sort of irregularities that she claimed to be \"hearing from the grass roots in certain states.\" Asked for specifics about the fraud that concerned her, Thomas said: \"I can't say that I was familiar at the time with any specific evidence. I was just hearing it from news reports and friends on the ground, grassroots activists who were inside of various polling places that found things suspicious.\" Thomas previously acknowledged that she attended the rally that preceded the Capitol riots on Jan. 6, though she toldThe Washington Free Beaconthat she left before then-President Trump addressed the crowd.

All attendees were provided with asustainable fashion guidethis year asking guests to re-wear, rent or buy vintage. Kate adhered to the guidelines, rewearing a gorgeous gold and white Alexander McQueen gown, which waspreviously worn during a 2012 state dinner in Malaysia.The mom of three accessorized with a necklace and earrings from Van Cleef and Arpels — that cost over $15,000 — as well as gold Jimmy Choo heels. At theRoyal Variety Performanceat the Palladium Theatre in London, the Duchess of Cambridge opted for a floor-length, black gown with intricate lace patterns by Alexander McQueen paired with dangling Erdem earrings. Whileattending the naming ceremony of the U.K.’s new polar research ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, in Birkenhead, Kate recycled her light blue coat dress by Alexander McQueen, which she’s worn on several occasions dating back to 2014. She kept the rest of her look simple, wearing black heels and carrying a black clutch by Asprey, with her hair in her signature bouncy blowout. For Trooping the Colour, the most royal event of the season, Kate stepped out in a pale yellow ensemble by Alexander McQueen and a matching hat by Philip Treacy with floral detail. Known forrecycling favorite pieces from her closet,this event was no exception. She previously wore the fashionable headtopper toPrince Harryand Meghan’s royal wedding in May 2018.

Kate also wore her go-toLover’s Knot tiarapaired with the Queen Mother’s sapphire and diamond fringe earrings.

For the2018 Trooping the Colour celebrations, Kate wore a pastel blue Alexander McQueen dress with a square-neckline, matching with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, and topped it off with a coordinating fascinator. For her brother-in-law Prince Harry’s wedding to Meghan Markle, Katerewore her an Alexander McQueen coat dress, pairing it with nude Jimmy Choo pumps. She first debuted at her daughter Princess Charlotte’s christening in 2015 before recyling it for Trooping the Colour in 2016. During Kate and Prince William’svisit to the royal palace in Oslo, Norwayas part their four-day tour of Scandinavia, Kate was escorted by King Harald of Norway for an official dinner held in their honor. The royal, who was pregnant with Prince Louis at the time, was impossibly chic in a flowing blush gown from Alexander McQueen. Kate accessorized her gown, which featured a crystal flower detailing on the neckline, with gorgeous diamond drop earrings and the same diamond braceletQueen Elizabethwore on her wedding day in 1947. Onday two of their tour of Swedenand Norway,Prince WilliamandKate Middletonteamed up withCrown Princess Victoriaand Prince Daniel to visit a Stockholm school where children take part in an innovative mentoring program to foster mental health. Kate wore a white, boucle dress by Alexander McQueen for the occasion, pairing the ensemble with earrings by Swedish designer In2Design and a chic Chanel bag. During Kate and Prince William’s tour of Poland, where they brought Prince George and Princess Charlotte, Kate showed off her stunning airport style when she stepped onto the tarmac in Warsaw in awhite Alexander McQueen peplum skirt suitand nude heels— a look she hasperfected over the years. At the2017 Royal Ascot, a horse racing event and one of Queen Elizabeth’s favorite events, the royal mom of three opted for a opted for awhite lace Alexander McQueen dresswith a bespoke fascinator for the first day.

For her younger sisterPippa Middleton’s wedding to James Matthews, Princess Kate made another stellar entrance in a dusty pink, pleated chiffon dress by Alexander McQueen. For herfirst-ever debut at the EE British Academy Film Awards(BAFTAs), the royal mom walked the red carpet in a jaw-dropping black, floral-printed ensemble from Alexander McQueen with her hair up in a classic chignon to show off her chandelier-style earrings. The gown featured off-the-shoulder straps and tiers of gathered fabric.

To cheer on Andy Murray in the men’s singles finals against Milos Raonic at Wimbledon, Kate kept up her impeccable courtside style, sportingan Alexander McQueen white dress with fun designs. Kate was all kinds of merry and bright when she and Prince William attended the Anna Feud Centre’sChristmas party in 2015wearing a red dress by Alexander McQueen. For her daughterPrincess Charlotte’s christening, Princess Kate wore a white Alexander McQueen ensemble (she wore this again to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s nuptials almost three years later!) and white Jane Taylor hat. Unlike in past Remembrance Day celebrations, Kate opted fora simpler look in 2014, going with a double-breasted black Alexander McQueen coat with an angular lapel. Wearing her hair down again, the royal mom capped things off with a pair of round earrings as well as a black hat. Though not one to sport a lot of grey hues, Kate manages to pull it off with this amazing coat designed by Alexander McQueen while attending the ceremonial welcome for Singapore’s President Tony Tan Keng Yam for a state visit. Kate fit right in with Hollywood’s finest at aBAFTA dinnerin Los Angeles as she stepped out in a lilac Alexander McQueen creation, Jimmy Choo sandals and clutch, and earrings borrowed from the Queen.

She topped off the look with suede navy pumps. For herwedding reception, Kate stayed loyal to Alexander McQueen as she slipped into another one of the designer Sarah Burton’s stunning creations: a white satin strapless evening gown with a circle skirt and diamante detailing around the waist. She topped the look with a simple white shrug, warming her up in the breezy 60-degree weather. Last, but definitely not least, isthe dress that started it all. How could anyone forget Princess Kate’s breathtaking lace wedding gown? Kate, who admitted topre-wedding jitters, was resplendent in a fitted white V-neck gown with a long-sleeved lace overlay, designed by McQueen creative director Sarah Burton. Her two-meter, 70-centimeter train was folded next to her in the car as she was transported to Westminster Abbey. The dress was composed of French Chantilly lace and English Cluny lace throughout the bodice, skirt and underskirt. The skirt, made of ivory and white satin gazar, was designed to emulate an opening flower: padded at the hips, it flowed out to the floor. The back of the dress was finished with 58 gazar and organza covered buttons fastened by Rouleau loops.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Omarosa Manigault Newman, a veteran of reality TV’sThe Apprenticeand former White House aide, makes a number ofshocking claims about President Donald Trumpin her new book, but perhaps none is more consequential to the nation than her portrait of him as a man in “mental decline,” who would “forget from one day to the next.” “He was distracted, irritable, and short,” Newman, 44, writes inUnhinged: An Insider’s Account of the Trump White House,out Tuesday,about a briefing she had with the president. “I was going over his speech, but he couldn’t retain any of the bullet points. I went over them again and again, and what he should say to the press after the event.” She adds, “But he couldn’t remember the key points and stumbled over the large words, which we scratched out and replaced with simpler terms.” Newman wasfired from the White House in December 2017. In his own book published earlier this year and titledFire and Fury, journalist Michael Wolff, who had been granted extraordinary access to Trump’s West Wing, wrote that the 72-year-old president’sclosest aides universally criticize him and express fears about his mental fitness. “They say he’s a moron, an idiot,” Michael Wolff said in an NBC News interview in January 2018.“He’s like a pinball just shooting off the sides.” In Newman’s most recent account, Trump has changed drastically since she first met him on the set ofThe Apprentice. She writes that in 2003, Trump was “as smart and shrewd as he claimed to be.” When discussing figures duringThe Apprentice‘s first season, Trump could “repeat a lengthy numbers sequence” without any references and calculate them accurately, according to the book. “Now?” Newman writes, “The blade had been dulled.” Trump was quick tocut her down on TwitterMonday, aftershe released new audioof a phone call she had with the president about being fired by White House chief of staff John Kelly. Trump described her in histweetas “vicious, but not smart.” He added in another tweet, Tuesday, “When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!” When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)August 14, 2018 Press secretarySarah Huckabee Sandersissued a statement saying that Newman’s book “is riddled with lies and false accusations,” adding: “it’s sad that a disgruntled former White House employee is trying to profit off these false attacks, and even worse that the media would now give her a platform, after not taking her seriously when she had only positive things to say about the President during her time in the administration.” The White House has not immediately responded to PEOPLE’s request for comment on Newman’s specific assertions about Trump’s mental health. Omarosa Manigault Newman Snaps at Savannah Guthrie During Heated Interview: ‘Slow Down’ InUnhinged, Newman’s woven multiple examples of what she calls Trump’s “mental decline.” She reflects on how she felt when she first learned that Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, would serve as one of her father’s official advisors. The announcement prompted awave of backlash and accusations of nepotism. “You have two people, very close to [PresidentDonald Trump] whose purpose is not the country. The purpose is the man. And that’s a problem, because this is about serving your country,” Cindy McCainsaid onThe Viewshortly after the announcement. But for Newman, at the time, the news came as a relief. “Having known [Ivanka] for fourteen years and worked with her onThe Celebrity Apprentice, I knew she was competent and sharp,” Newman writes. “I made a note to set up a meeting to share with her my concerns about her father’s forgetfulness and strange behavior. I would often say, ‘He needs you. I’m glad you’re here.'” As examples of the changes in Trump’s mental health, she also cites his “nuclear” bouts of temper and the strange moment on Nov. 15, 2017,when he used two hands to drink from a water bottle on TV. This was, according the Newman, Trump having “a small episode of some kind.” Newman doesn’t stop there. She explains that Trump was “fixated” on repeating the same story for weeks. According to the book, Trump couldn’t stop telling people about his decision todrop the “Mother of All Bombs” in an Islamic State cave networkin Afghanistan in April 2017. “I seriously began to suspect that the president was delusional or had a mental condition, that made him forget from one day to the next,” she writes. “Was Donald like Ronald Reagan, impaired while everyone around him ran the show and covered up for him? Was Mike Pence his Nancy Reagan, with the same vapid, adoring looks?” Beyond his mental state, Newman also claims inUnhingedthat Trump reads at an “eighth- or ninth-grade level,” and has “never read” in full any of the important pieces of legislation or “even some of these executive orders that he has signed.” Instead, his team presents him with bullet points. Michael Wolff has alsocontributed to the claims that Trump can’t read well. “He didn’t process information in any conventional sense,”Wolff wroteinFire and Fury. “He didn’t read. He didn’t really even skim. Some believed that for all practical purposes he was no more than semi-­literate.” Now Newman, once a loyal Trump supporter, is reckoning with what she sees as the perils of Trump’s presidency. “Trump’s charisma is all that matters. He has an ability to convince you that he’s right, and that everything is going to be fine,” Newman writes. “You choose to believe because the alternative is terrifying, that’s he’s not equipped with the basic skills to make crucial decisions that will impact the lives of millions of Americans and billions of people around the world.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: \"We got it wrong and we sincerely apologize,\" an IKEA spokesperson said in a statement An effort to honor Juneteenth for employees has spiraled downhill for one Georgia IKEA store. One of the franchise's locations is under fire after creating a special Juneteenth menu for staff that incorporated fried chicken and watermelon. On Thursday, June 17, President Joe Biden signed a bill to officially declare Juneteenth a federal holiday. The holiday,occurring on June 19 every year, marks the end of slavery in the U.S., which ultimately came in 1865 - two-and-a-half years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. In honor of the federal holiday, manycompanies introduced unique waysthey would celebrate, announcing paid days off for employees, educational programs for building equity, donating to organizations fighting racism, and more. An Atlanta branch of IKEA announced to staff that the store would incorporate a holiday menu, which featured food that has been used historically to stereotype Black culture and people. \"To honor the perseverance of Black Americans and acknowledge the progress yet to be made, we observe Juneteenth on Saturday, June 19, 2021,\" said an email,acquired byTMZ, which was sent to employees. \"Look out for a special menu on Saturday which will include: fried chicken, watermelon, mac n cheese, potato salad, collard greens, candied yams,\" the message continued. RELATED VIDEO: The History and Celebration of Juneteenth RELATED: Here's How Cities and Towns Across the Country Are Celebrating Juneteenth The menu immediately sparked outrage among employees with over 20 staff members calling out from work in protest. \"You cannot say serving watermelon on Juneteenth is a soul food menu when you don't even know the history -- they used to feed slaves watermelon during the slavery time,\" one employee toldCBS. The outlet reportsthat the manager of the Atlanta store sent a response apologizing for the menu, which read, \"I truly apologize if the menu came off as subjective. It was created with the best of intentions by a few of our coworkers who believed they were representing their culture and tradition with these foods of celebration.\" The corporation also issued an apology. \"In addition to offering Juneteenth as one of our paid holidays nationally, our IKEA Atlanta store has recognized Juneteenth with our co-workers for the past four years. To honor the day, a lunch menu was created with the best of intentions, including recommendations from Black co-workers,\" an IKEA spokesperson tells PEOPLE. \"We value our co-workers' voices and changed the menu after receiving feedback that the foods that were selected are not reflective of the deeply meaningful traditional foods historically served as part of Juneteenth celebrations.\" \"We got it wrong and we sincerely apologize,\" they continued. \"We are committed to educating ourselves and putting a process in place that will allow us to thoughtfully honor Juneteenth in the future.\"\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Asghar Farhadi‘sThe Salesmanwon the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar on Sunday as director Farhadi did not attend the ceremony in political protest. The Iranian drama, became something of a cause célèbre in the wake of President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries — including Iran — from entering the U.S. Farhadi condemned the ban last month and declared that he wouldnot attend the Oscars. The ban has since been halted by judicial decisions. On Sunday night, Farhadi’s friend Anousheh Ansari read a letter written by him in front of the Academy audience. “I’m sorry I am not with you tonight,” the letter read. “My absence is out of respect for those in my country and those in the six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.” “Dividing the world into the ‘us’ and ‘the enemy’ categories creates fear,” the letter continued. “A deceitful justification for regression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries in which have themselves have been victims of aggression. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions.” The letter also said added that filmmakers and their films can “create empathy between us and others. An empathy we need today more than ever. And break stereotypes and religions.” Backstage after the speech, Ansari told reporters Farhadi didn’t accept the award because “he wanted to stand in solidarity with the rest of the people who have been subject to the travel ban and are not able to go see their friends and family members and share important moments in their lives. To not be here receiving this award, which means a lot to him, and that’s a big message he’s sending.” Ansari continued, It was very difficult. As you know, this would be his second Oscar. It was a big deal for him. I think not coming, he felt it was important to make the statement he made, which I read on the stage.” Farhadi’s second Oscar win for Iran came in the wake of a screening ofThe Salesmanthat thousands attended in London. On Friday, all five nominees in the category released a joint statement of “emphatic disapproval of the climate of fanaticism and nationalism we see today in the U.S. and in so many other countries, in parts of the population and, most unfortunately of all, among leading politicians.” The letter did not mention Trump by name, but did call out the inflammatory rhetoric being used nationwide against immigrants and people of color. “The fear generated by dividing us into genders, colors, religions and sexualities as a means to justify violence destroys the things that we depend on – not only as artists but as humans: the diversity of cultures, the chance to be enriched by something seemingly “foreign” and the belief that human encounters can change us for the better. These divisive walls prevent people from experiencing something simple but fundamental: from discovering that we are all not so different,” the statement read. “So we’ve asked ourselves: What can cinema do? Although we don’t want to overestimate the power of movies, we do believe that no other medium can offer such deep insight into other people’s circumstances and transform feelings of unfamiliarity into curiosity, empathy and compassion – even for those we have been told are our enemies.” The nominees added, “Regardless of who wins the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film on Sunday, we refuse to think in terms of borders. We believe there is no best country, best gender, best religion or best color. We want this award to stand as a symbol of the unity between nations and the freedom of the arts. “Human rights are not something you have to apply for. They simply exist – for everybody. For this reason, we dedicate this award to all the people, artists, journalists and activists who are working to foster unity and understanding, and who uphold freedom of expression and human dignity – values whose protection is now more important than ever. By dedicating the Oscar to them, we wish to express to them our deep respect and solidarity.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: This post originally appeared onTime. WASHINGTON —President Donald Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, secretly worked for a Russian billionaire to advance the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin a decade ago and proposed an ambitious political strategy to undermine anti-Russian opposition across former Soviet republics, The Associated Press has learned. The work appears to contradict assertions by the Trump administration and Manafort himself that he never worked for Russian interests. Manafort proposed in a confidential strategy plan as early as June 2005 that he would influence politics, business dealings and news coverage inside the United States, Europe and the former Soviet republics to benefit the Putin government, even as U.S.-Russia relations under Republican President George W. Bush grew worse. Manafort pitched the plans to Russian aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work. “We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success,” Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, “will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.” Manafort’s plans were laid out in documents obtained by the AP that included strategy memoranda and records showing international wire transfers for millions of dollars. How much work Manafort performed under the contract was unclear. The disclosure comes as Trump campaign advisers are the subject of an FBI probe and two congressional investigations. Investigators are reviewing whether the Trump campaign and its associates coordinated with Moscow to meddle in the 2016 campaign. Manafort has dismissed the investigations as politically motivated and misguided, and said he never worked for Russian interests. The documents obtained by AP show Manafort’s ties to Russia were closer than previously revealed.In a statement to the AP, Manafort confirmed that he worked for Deripaska in various countries but said the work was being unfairly cast as “inappropriate or nefarious” as part of a “smear campaign.”“I worked with Oleg Deripaska almost a decade ago representing him on business and personal matters in countries where he had investments,” Manafort said. “My work for Mr. Deripaska did not involve representing Russian political interests.” Deripaska became one of Russia’s wealthiest men under Putin, buying assets abroad in ways widely perceived to benefit the Kremlin’s interests. U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 described Deripaska as “among the 2-3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad.” In response to questions about Manafort’s consulting firm, a spokesman for Deripaska in 2008 — at least three years after they began working together — said Deripaska had never hired the firm. Another Deripaska spokesman in Moscow last week declined to answer AP’s questions. Manafort worked as Trump’s unpaid campaign chairman last year from March until August. Trumpasked Manafort to resignafter AP revealed that Manafort had orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation until 2014 on behalf of Ukraine’s ruling pro-Russian political party.The newly obtained business records link Manafort more directly to Putin’s interests in the region. According to those records and people with direct knowledge of Manafort’s work for Deripaska, Manafort made plans to open an office in Moscow, and at least some of Manafort’s work in Ukraine was directed by Deripaska, not local political interests there. The Moscow office never opened.Manafort has been a leading focus of the U.S. intelligence investigation of Trump’s associates and Russia, according to a U.S. official. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the investigation were confidential. Meanwhile, federal criminal prosecutors became interested in Manafort’s activities years ago as part of a broad investigation to recover stolen Ukraine assets after the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych there in early 2014. No U.S. criminal charges have ever been filed in the case. FBI Director James Comey, in confirming to Congress the federal intelligence investigation this week, declined to say whether Manafort was a target. Manafort’s name was mentioned 28 times during the hearing of the House Intelligence Committee, mostly about his work in Ukraine. No one mentioned Deripaska. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Monday that Manafort “played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time” in the campaign, even though as Trump’s presidential campaign chairman he led it during the crucial run-up to the Republican National Convention. Manafort and his associates remain in Trump’s orbit. Manafort told a colleague this year that he continues to speak with Trump by telephone. Manafort’s former business partner in eastern Europe, Rick Gates, has been seen inside the White House on a number of occasions. Gates has since helped plan Trump’s inauguration and now runs a nonprofit organization, America First Policies, to back the White House agenda. Gates, whose name does not appear in the documents, told the AP that he joined Manafort’s firm in 2006 and was aware Manafort had a relationship with Deripaska, but he was not aware of the work described in the memos. Gates said his work was focused on domestic U.S. lobbying and political consulting in Ukraine at the time. He said he stopped working for Manafort’s firm in March 2016 when he joined Trump’s presidential campaign. Manafort told Deripaska in 2005 that he was pushing policies as part of his work in Ukraine “at the highest levels of the U.S. government — the White House, Capitol Hill and the State Department,” according to the documents. He also said he had hired a “leading international law firm with close ties to President Bush to support our client’s interests,” but he did not identify the firm. Manafort also said he was employing unidentified legal experts for the effort at leading universities and think tanks, including Duke University, New York University and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Manafort did not disclose details about the lobbying work to the Justice Department during the period the contract was in place. Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, people who lobby in the U.S. on behalf of foreign political leaders or political parties must provide detailed reports about their actions to the department. Willfully failing to register is a felony and can result in up to five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, though the government rarely files criminal charges. FROM COINAGE: This Is How Much It Would Cost to Paint the White House (And More Crazy Facts) Deripaska owns Basic Element Co., which employs 200,000 people worldwide in the agriculture, aviation, construction, energy, financial services, insurance and manufacturing industries, and he runs one of the world’s largest aluminum companies. Forbes estimated his net worth at $5.2 billion. How much Deripaska paid Manafort in total is not clear, but people familiar with the relationship said money transfers to Manafort amounted to tens of millions of dollars and continued through at least 2009. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the secret payments publicly. In strategy memos, Manafort proposed that Deripaska and Putin would benefit from lobbying Western governments, especially the U.S., to allow oligarchs to keep possession of formerly state-owned assets in Ukraine. He proposed building “long term relationships” with Western journalists and a variety of measures to improve recruitment, communications and financial planning by pro-Russian parties in the region. Manafort proposed extending his existing work in eastern Europe to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Georgia, where he pledged to bolster the legitimacy of governments friendly to Putin and undercut anti-Russian figures through political campaigns, nonprofit front groups and media operations. For the $10 million contract, Manafort did not use his public-facing consulting firm, Davis Manafort. Instead, he used a company, LOAV Ltd., that he had registered in Delaware in 1992. He listed LOAV as having the same address of his lobbying and consulting firms in Alexandria, Virginia. In other records, LOAV’s address was listed as Manafort’s home, also in Alexandria. Manafort sold the home in July 2015 for $1.4 million. He now owns an apartment in Trump Tower in New York, as well as other properties in Florida and New York. One strategy memo to Deripaska was written by Manafort and Rick Davis, his business partner at the time. In written responses to the AP, Davis said he did not know that his firm had proposed a plan to covertly promote the interests of the Russian government. RELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack Davis said he believes Manafort used his name without his permission on the strategy memo. “My name was on every piece of stationery used by the company and in every memo prior to 2006. It does not mean I had anything to do with the memo described,” Davis said. He took a leave of absence from the firm in late 2006 to work on John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Manafort’s work with Deripaska continued for years, though they had a falling out laid bare in 2014 in a Cayman Islands bankruptcy court. The billionaire gave Manafort nearly $19 million to invest in a Ukrainian TV company called Black Sea Cable, according to legal filings by Deripaska’s representatives. It said that after taking the money, Manafort and his associates stopped responding to Deripaska’s queries about how the funds had been used. Early in the 2016 presidential campaign, Deripaska’s representatives openly accused Manafort of fraud and pledged to recover the money from him. After Trump earned the nomination, Deripaska’s representatives said they would no longer discuss the case.Associated Press writers Jack Gillum, Eric Tucker, Julie Pace, Ted Bridis, Stephen Braun and Julie Bykowicz contributed to this report in Washington; Nataliya Vasilyeva contributed from Moscow and Kiev, Ukraine; and Jake Pearson contributed from New York.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: More shocking claims about the inner workings ofPresident Donald Trump‘s White House were released Thursday from author andHollywood Reportercolumnist Michael Wolff. In an essay forTHR,Wolff alleges that Trump has had trouble recognizing old friends, and that staffers refer to Trump’s daughterIvankaas his “real wife” and White House Communications Director Hope Hicks as his “real daughter.” The allegations are just a few also found in Wolff’s upcoming bookFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House(out Jan. 9), which chronicles his extensive time spent at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and which included more than 200 interviews with Trump and senior staff over a period of 18 months. “At Mar-a-Lago, just before the new year, a heavily made-up Trump failed to recognize a succession of old friends,” Wolff writes — a seeming hint that the president’s memory may be fading. (Back in November, Joe Scarborough made similar claims on MSNBC’sMorning Joe, saying thatpeople close to the president have said he has shown early signs of dementia). RELATED STORY:Kellyanne Conway Put Finger-Gun to Her Head, Sean Spicer Swears and More from New Book on ‘Insane’ Trump White House As for Ivanka, Wolff claims that part of the “insanity” and “foolishness” happening in the West Wing has been the president’s “inability to deal with his own family,” and that giving Ivanka and her husband,Jared Kushner, leadership roles “was to compound his own boundless inexperience in Washington, creating from the outset frustration and then disbelief and then rage on the part of the professionals in his employ.” Hicks, meanwhile, has become Trump’s “most powerful White House advisor,” Wolff alleges. The 29-year-old confidant’s primary function? “To tend to the Trump ego,” Wolff writes — “to reassure him, to protect him, to buffer him, to soothe him.” “With [First Lady] Melania a nonpresence, the staff referred to Ivanka as the ‘real wife’ and Hicks as the ‘real daughter,’ ” Wolff claims. The author also asserts that “it was Hicks who, attentive to [Trump’s] lapses and repetitions, urged him to forgo an interview that was set to open the60 Minutesfall season. Instead, the interview went to Fox News’ Sean Hannity who, White House insiders happily explained, was willing to supply the questions beforehand.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Kourtney, Kim and Khloé opened their first DASH boutique together in their hometown of Calabasas, California, in 2006 — one year beforeKeeping Up with the Kardashianspremiered and Katapulted their family to stardom. \"When the opportunity for our TV show came about, I wanted to do it to bring attention to our stores,\" Kim toldVarietyin 2015. \"I was thinking this might not last very long, but we’ll grow a great business and expand online. I thought it would be great press. I didn’t think it would turn into what it turned into.\" \"Great press\" is perhaps the understatement of the century. DASH became a regular meeting point in the first seasons of their hit E! reality show, and soon Kim’s hope to \"expand online\" evolved into brick-and-mortar expansions, each with its own spin-off show documenting the store opening (Kourtney and Kim Take MiamiandKourtney and Kim Take New York). Dash Dollsfollowed in 2015, highlighting the personal lives and workplace dramas of the boutique's employees as they strove to represent the Kardashian brand. Over a decade after opening, the sisters announced in April 2018 that they wereclosing the boutique chainin order to focus on their personal brands and their families. Ever wonder how Kim Kardashian West manages to look impossibly sleek underneath even the most form-fitting clothes? When she's not wearing couture corsets (see her mind-boggling Met Gala look), she swears by shapewear — and now, the beauty mogul islaunching her very own line. Kimono Solutionwear™ \"is my take on shapewear and solutions for women that actually work,\" Kardashian West announced on Instagram on June 25. The collection comes in a range of sizes (XXS to 4XL) and nine neutral tones. Some called Kim out for cultural appropriation regarding the name of the line; in response, she told theNew York Timesit's “a nod to the beauty and detail that goes into a garment” and she does not plan on changing the name or designing any items that “resemble or dishonor the traditional garment.” “I understand and have deep respect for the significance of the kimono in Japanese culture,” shesaid in her statement. “My solutionwear brand is built with inclusivity and diversity at its core and I’m incredibly proud of what’s to come.” The makeup mogul made her official foray into skincare on May 22, withthe launch of Kylie Skin. The new, affordable line currently features six core products (and they're all under $30): Foaming Face Wash, Walnut Face Scrub, Vanilla Milk Toner, Face Moisturizer, Vitamin C Serum and Eye Cream. While fans were mostly eager to try out the makeup mogul's new line, Kyliereceived some backlashover the use of walnut powder in her Walnut Face Scrub, which is a controversial exfoliant that many believe is too abrasive on the skin. The Kardashian-Jenner family has risen to the top of the A-list in the years sinceKUWTKfirst aired. And while they've all been diligently building their businesses outside of social media and reality TV, Kim saw an opportunity to cash in on the collective cultural obsession with their glamorous lifestyle: allow fans to try their hands at making it big in Hollywood. Since launching Kim Kardashian: Hollywood in 2014, the choose-your-own-adventure-style game has been downloaded more than 40 million times and generated $74.3 million in its first six months alone, according toForbes. The game challenges users to channel their inner Kardashian and chart their own course to fame, rising from the E-list to the A-list as they go on dates, meet with industry insiders and forge connections. The app itself is free, but encourages you to buy new clothes (including replicas of outfits Kim's actually worn) and other objects using the in-app purchase currency in order to improve your social status and afford invitations to bigger and better parties. What’s that bit about \"art imitates life\" again? Hot on the heels of younger sister Kylie’s enormous success in the beauty industry, Kimlaunched KKW Beautyin June 2017. The initial collection included four contour kits in various neutral shades, and has since expanded to include a full range of beauty products, from lipsticks and eyeshadow palettes to her newest line ofbody makeup. Shortly after Khloé's dramatic and drawn-out split from ex-husband Lamar Odomendedin December 2016, theKUWTKstar lost around 40 lbs. \"It'sa revenge body[for Odom],\" she said of her fitness transformation. \"But it's just as much for all my critics who called me 'the fat one' for my entire existence.\" Sparked by her own weight loss and confidence boost, Khloé createdRevenge Body, a TV show dedicated to helping people achieve their weight and lifestyle goals. Now in its third season, the show features celebrity trainers as well as beauty and style experts to encourage a full lifestyle transformation in participants. Only a true entrepreneur like Kim could turn herpenchant for snapping selfiesinto a best-selling, must-have coffee table book. Published in May 2015, the book is filled with selfies of all varieties: solo, sultry, siblings, semi-nude — and it's genuinely mesmerizing. Following in their older siblings footsteps, Kendall and Kylie Jenner launched their eponymous clothing line back in 2013. For their first collaboration with PacSun, the then-teenagers adamantly avoided consulting their sisters for advice. \"We were like, 'This is our project. Leave us alone,' \"Kylie told PEOPLEat the time. The Jenner siblings have quietly continued to collaborate on their line as their styles have evolved over the years, most recently launching an exclusive Spring 2019 collection withRevolve. Named the world'syoungest self-made billionaire byForbesearlier this year, Kylie proved she's a mogul not to be messed with when she turned the endless conversations aboutthe origin of her popular poutinto a near-billion dollar business three years ago. From mesmerizing videos of swatch-testing eyeshadows on her arms to the frenzy of selling out lip kits within minutes of each new product launch, Kylie's cult following has continued to grow since her company's launch in 2015. And after years of selling the products exclusively on her website or in pop-up shops, sheexpanded into Ultain 2018 — prompting a 9 percent revenue increase. Her DASH days may be over, but helping people find clothing that celebrates their bodies is still a passion of the youngest Kardashian sibling. In October 2016, theRevenge Bodystar launched what soon became a cult-favorite brand: Good American. Initially a denim line, the jeans filled a gap in the market for women with rounder bottoms (à la her sister Kim) and offered a wide range of sizes. As a seemingly natural extension of the brand, the famous fitness queen then launched a collection of activewear, and most recently introduced a line ofchic dressesmade with compression fabric to help your body hold its shape. Kourtney is fed up with peopletelling her she doesn't work— especially when it comes from her own family. Months after she and Kim got in an explosive fight onKUWTKover scheduling issues and Kim criticized her work ethic — saying \"Maybe if you had a f—ing business that you were passionate about [you would be more considerate]\" — Kourt proved the haters (and her sister) wrong bylaunching a new lifestyle website, Poosh, in April 2019. The site (named for daughter Penelope's nickname) is a destination for fans to soak up the mom of three's tips and tricks on all things fashion, beauty, wellness, food, home and more. \"I decided to launch Poosh because I felt that there was something missing in the healthy lifestyle space. Healthy living gets a bad wrap; it’s as though if you care about what you put in — or on — your body, then you’re not sexy or cool. But this just isn’t true, and Poosh is here to prove just that,\" she writes on the site. Does Kim ever sleep? In addition to growing her beauty empire, the mom of four is determined to use her platform to make a difference — and the route she’s chosen may come as a surprise for some. The reality TV star revealed toVoguein April 2019 that she’sstudying to become a lawyerand has taken on a four-year apprenticeship with a law firm in San Francisco, with the goal of taking the bar in 2022. For months, she’s been working with author and CNN commentator Van Jones and attorney Jessica Jackson, cofounders of #cut50, a national bipartisan advocacy group on criminal-justice reform. In the process, she’s visited prisons, petitioned governors and notably succeeded in petitioning President Donald Trump to commute the life sentence ofAlice Marie Johnson, a nonviolent drug offender. \"It’s kind of crazy because I’m learning it all as I go,\" she admitted to the outlet. \"I spend more time on this than I do anything else. It’s insane but it’s so fun to be around people that are super smart and get it and want the same thing.\" After being made into aviral meme, Kylie decided to capitalize on her moment and releasedtwo new hoodieson her official online merchandise shop. Labeled as limited edition, the hoodies — which bear her now-famous “Riiise and Shiiinnee” slogan — cost $65 each and are estimated to ship four to five weeks after ordering fromThe Kylie Shop. The source of the viral moment is a YouTube video in which Jennergives a tourof her Kylie Cosmetics offices. Toward the end of the clip, the business-savvy CEO enters her daughterStormi Webster‘s playroom, waking the 20-month-old with the morning greeting. Longtime true crime lover Khloé is set to produce her second show for Investigation Discovery, entitledTwisted Love,premiering on Feb. 3, 2020. Following her first true crime series —Twisted Sisters, which delved into crimes committed by sisters — the new series follows six tales of love gone horribly wrong. \"I love the idea of love, but these stories will stun even the most hopeless romantic.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Democrats are calling on U.S. Rep.-electGeorge Santosto resign before he is sworn in next week, following the incoming lawmaker's confirmation that he lied about several aspects of his past — including his education, career and religious background. On Monday Santos, 34, toldThe New York Postthathe lied aboutworking at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, and confirmed that he had also embellished his education, noting that he did not attend Baruch College or New York University as he'd previously claimed. \"I didn't graduate from any institution of higher learning,\" Santos said on Monday to thePost. \"I'm embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume. I own up to that ... we do stupid things in life.\" Santos' interview with thePostcame days afterhis lies were uncovered in an investigationbyThe New York Times,which found that there were significant parts of his lifethat could not be verified. While Santos said the lies would not stop him from taking the oath of office on Jan. 3, House Democrats are calling on him to resign. California Rep.Ted Lieu, who will soon be vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, wrote on Twitter: \"GOP Congressman-elect George Santos, who has now admitted his whopping lies, should resign. If he does not, then @GOPLeader should call for a vote to expel @Santos4Congress.\" Texas Rep.Joaquin Castroechoed Lieu, adding that Santos should also be investigated over his claims. \"George Santos should resign as Congressman-elect. If he refuses, Congress should expel him,\" Castro wrote. \"He should also be investigated by authorities. Just about every aspect of his life appears to be a lie. We've seen people fudge their resume but this is total fabrication.\" Speaking to thePost, Santos also denied that he had previously claimed he was Jewish, after a report from Jewish newspaperForwardcalled into questionwhether his grandparents were actually Jewish immigrantswho fled persecution duringWorld War II, as his website had previously claimed. \"George's grandparents fled Jewish persecution in Ukraine, settled in Belgium, and again fled persecution during WWII,\"Santos' website readlast week. (The About page containing the information has since been removed from his site.) \"I never claimed to be Jewish,\" Santos toldThe Post. \"I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was 'Jew-ish.'\" But some questions about Santos' past remain unanswered — including thoseregarding his financial backing. According to theTimes, Santos was a call center employee for Dish Network in 2012, found that his family frequently struggled to pay rent in Queens over the years, borrowed thousands of dollars from a friend which the acquaintance said he never repaid. By 2020, Santos had launched a run for the house, stating in a financial disclosure that year that he had no assets and no earned income. But his financial situation appeared to have markedly improved by the time he decided to launch a second run for the House in 2022, with Federal Election Commission filings showing he lent at least $580,000 to his campaign, and $27,000 to his political action committee.

In an on-camera interview withCity and State NYon Monday, Santos claimed he \"started building wealth\" after opening a company called the Devolder Organization, saying: \"it just worked because I had the relationships and I started making a lot of money. And I fundamentally started building wealth.\" When he entered politics, he told the radio show, \"I decided I'd invest in my race for Congress. There's nothing wrong with that.\" According toThe Washington Post, documents filed with the Florida secretary of state show that the company — which Santos has said is a privately-held family firm — was organized just one month before the Republican declared his latest candidacy in 2021.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

After an extensive vetting process, Darweesh was granted a special immigrant visa. On Friday — the same day President Donald Trump signedan executive order banning nationals from Iraqand six other Muslim countries — he, his wife and children flew into New York City’s John F. Kennedy airport. “They get off the plane, his wife and his kids are OK and he is suddenly marched away and he thinks, ‘What the heck?’ ” Nadler says. “They held him for 19 hours, he was on a chair, he didn’t have any place to sleep, and he was terrified. He thought the United States was a great country and what are they doing?” After Nadler, N.Y. congresswoman Nydia Velazquez and attorneys for Darweesh spoke to people the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, Darweesh was released Saturday afternoon. At a press conference following his release, Darweesh began to cry as he spoke to reporters, and put his hands behind his back to mime handcuffs,”reports theNew York Times. RELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack “What I do for this country? They put the cuffs on,” Mr. Darweesh said. “You know how many soldiers I touch by this hand?” At the press conference, Nadler called Trump’s order “discriminatory … and frankly quite disgusting.” As a crowd of protestorsswelled at J.F.K. airport, Nadler tells PEOPLE that another detained Iraqi refugee, Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, whose wife worked for American forces for years, was enroute to the U.S. to reunite with his wife, who is already in the States. “These are people who helped our military,” Nadler says. “They certainly are not dangerous.” He and Velazquez are continuing to work on the release of Alshawi and the 10 other refugees detained at J.F.K., he tells PEOPLE. Trump’s executive order temporarily bans all citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. It also put a temporary 120-day ban on all refugees entering the country with an indefinite ban placed on refugees from war-torn Syria. The executive order also creates a “religious test” of refugees, giving preferential treatment to Christians and minority religions in Muslim countries over Muslims. Trump, who said on Saturday that the ban was “not a Muslim ban,” despite campaigning on such a ban and being labelled a “Muslim ban” by his critics, said the order was created to ostensibly protect the United State from foreign-born terrorists in the wake of 9/11. “We don’t want them here,” Trump said while signing the order at the Pentagon on Friday. “We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country, and love deeply our people.” However, the ban does not include any of the countries where the 9/11 terrorists came from — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Lebanon. “One wonders what basis he chose the countries he chose as opposed to Saudi Arabia or Turkey or Egypt,” says Nadler. “We know terrorists have come from those countries.” Early Saturday, lawyers representing Darweesh and Alshawi filed a writ of habeas corpus seeking to have their clients released, and a motion for class certification to represent all refugees and immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry, according to theNew York Times. Betsy Fisher, policy director of the International Refugee Assistance Project, which helped file the complaint, tells PEOPLE that Darweesh has reunited with his family but is not sure where their next stop is. Fisher is hearing reports of people being denied the ability to board a plane overseas to reunite with their families in the U.S., even if they are legal permanent residents. “It’s horrifying to see these actions being taken,” she says, “but at the same time there as a lot of campaign rhetoric to let you know that something was coming. In some ways we knew to expect this.” According to the executive order, some refugees may still be allowed to enter the U.S. on a case-by-case basis as determined by both the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security. It is unclear if the executive order would allow such exceptions for those not seeking refugee status who are still affected by the ban, buta White House source told PEOPLEthat some visitors — like Oscar-nominated director Asghar Farhardi, who is from Iran — would qualify for a waiver. However, there were no details on what that waiver entails. In response to the ban, a protest immediately flared up outside J.F.K. airport. Sister protests in support of refugees have also popped up, including a demonstration outside Los Angeles’ L.A.X. airport.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Sydney Kamen looks at soap differently than most people do. While many look at it as a constant, Kamen sees it as a vital weapon in the war against poor hygiene that allows Ebola, cholera and other fatal diseases to flourish. She has watched the eyes of people in Thailand, Myanmar and other impoverished countries widen as they are offered a bar of the precious commodity—that can sell for more than 25 percent of their weekly wages. “I know people probably ask, ‘What does a girl from Washington, D.C., know about people not having access to water or sanitation?’ ” says Kamen, a 20-year-old Dartmouth College student. “But I’ve seen a lot that is incredibly shocking and appalling.” Kamen says her parents raised her to give back to the community. Some of her earliest memories include volunteering at soup kitchens and volunteering for service trips throughout the world. During relief mission trip to Haiti when she was 15, she worked side-by-side with other volunteers – including dentists and oral surgeons — to build oral care clinics, then watched as adults and children lined up in near suffocating heat for treatment of everything from gingivitis to tooth loss and abscesses. “Those service trips gave me the exposure to sanitation issues,” Kamen tells PEOPLE. “More than 1.8 million children die each year of pneumonia and diarrhea.” Four years ago, Kamen foundedSo Others Are Protected (SOAP). She launched the program in Thailand and has watched as it has grown. Workers gather donations of used soap from luxury hotels, then local at-risk women and children are employed to clean, melt, reshape and recycle the soap for distribution in rural and high-risk communities. “It’s not me but partner communities that do the work. I am not on the ground, recycling soap. I’m not reselling soap,” she says. “But I had the idea and it came about because of all my partners.” Kamen’s program has expanded to 14 community partners, 13 hotel partners and more than 50,000 bars of recycled soap. She is the recipient of the President’s Volunteer Service Award, the Daily Points of Light Award and many other accolades including her designation as one of 15 recipients of the Diller Teen Tikkun Olam Award for exceptional leadership and engagement in service projects. Award representative Erica Aren says that many factors made Kamen’s candidacy stand out among the hundreds of worthy nominees. “Sydney’s project demonstrates her willingness to go outside of her comfort zone and look for sustainable solutions. She saw a problem in under-resourced communities and looked for viable approaches within the local region that would provide those communities with tools to work toward self-reliance,” Aren tells PEOPLE. “She is an empowered and inspiring young leader poised to repair the world one bar of soap at a time!” No awards are needed to show Donato Obel, M.D. the value of Kamen’s program. He worked with her in the early days of the program and has seen the supplies enhance the lives of those that make and use the soap. “Miss Kamen came to Uganda in 2012 and did some volunteer work here in Eastern Uganda. We worked together on SOAP,” Dr. Obel wrote to PEOPLE as he traveled through Kenya. “My clinic receives soaps from a hotel in Mbale. This last year our women made [many hundreds of bars of] soap. We also now make soap with the school children to teach sanitation and disease prevention.” Melody Brown Burkins, Ph.D., associate director for programs and research at Dartmouth, counts Kamen among her top students at the Ivy League college. “The word dedication keeps coming back (when discussing Kamen). Dedication to public and community service. Dedication to issues of global health,” Brown Burkins tells PEOPLE. “How did she commit herself to this while she was still in high school? It makes no sense. But she is learning that is one act among many future acts she will experience in her lifetime. She tends to shy award from the spotlight but she’s learning that’s part of elevating the impact.” Kamen says she’s grateful for her partners, who have helped turn her project into a life-saving reality. “I had the idea, but this is their program,” she says. “That is the best way to have it run efficiently and smoothly – and grow.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The reality star is seen laughing and pulling at them before demonstrating his lack of mobility with a leg raise. “I’ll tell Audriana I’m going to be a ballerina,” he joked. Joe’s oldest daughter Gia, 18, commented, “still has me dying” with a handful of crying-laughing emojis. The post comes just days after Joe — who is living in his grandmother’s home in Sala Consilina as he awaits the final appeal in his deportation ruling  — joined Instagram. In one of his first posts, he shared a photo from a night out with family and friends, including Teresa’s father Giacinto Gorga. “Always a full table…” Joe captioned one group photo of him and Gorga dining together at a packed dinner table.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: As word came Wednesday that NBC News hadfiredTodayshow anchor Matt Lauer, citing “inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace,” many wondered when 2017’s sexual-misconduct reckoning would claim another alleged predator: President Donald Trump. Mira Sorvino believes the time is nigh. “You’re going down, @realDonaldTrump,” the actress wrote on Twitter Wednesday, in response to a tweet from another user who called out the president by quipping: “I know one former NBC star who needs to be investigated for sexual assault. He was on this show called The Apprentice….” Sorvino, 50, continued, “You already admitted in 2016 that the tape was real-you’ve admitted to #sexualassault & you have almost 20 women w/claims to back you up. Time to start packing-you are not immune & the cultural tide against sexual predators will sweep you away.” You’re going down,@realDonaldTrumpYou already admitted in 2016 that the tape was real-you’ve admitted to#sexualassault& you have almost 20 women w/claims to back you up. Time to start packing-you are not immune & the cultural tide against sexual predators will sweep you away.https://t.co/RJJPm6xgZN — Mira Sorvino (@MiraSorvino)November 29, 2017 No one is immune. Nixon proved that.https://t.co/VABKjlU482 — Mira Sorvino (@MiraSorvino)November 29, 2017 Responding to another tweet noting that Trump has — so far — seemed immune to the sexual misconduct allegations against him (all of which he has denied), Sorvino declared: “No one is immune. Nixon proved that.” Last month, Sorvino joined the dozens of women who haveaccusedHollywood producer Harvey Weinsteinof sexual harassment and assault. The actress shared her story in aNew Yorkerexposé about Weinstein, alleging that he sexually harassed her at the Toronto International Film Festival in 1995. Weinstein, through his lawyer, has denied all “allegations of non-consensual sex” against him. Sorvino explained her decisionto come forward in a piece for TIME last month, writing, “I have lived in vague fear of Harvey Weinstein for over 20 years. At the time I don’t think I even knew what happened — him using business-related situations to try and press himself sexually on a young woman in his employ — qualified as sexual harassment. But as a woman who routinely advocates for women and girls who have been victimized in my role as Goodwill Ambassador with the United Nations, and as a mother, I could no longer remain silent.” Sorvino isn’t the only one eagerly awaiting the president’s potential judgement day. During this last year, as the recentaccusations of sexual misconduct against a long list of powerful menin Hollywood and other industries have been widely believed — and led to resignations, loss of careers and other fallout — some of the more than a dozenwomen who have accused Trump of sexual harassment or assaultare wondering when the president might finally pay a price for what he allegedly did to them. For them, Trump’s tweet earlier on Wednesday celebrating Lauer’s firing rang hypocritical — to say the least. PEOPLE writer Natasha Stoynoff — who has accusedTrump of attacking herin 2005 by pushing her up against a wall at Mar-a- Lago and shoving his tongue down her throat — tells PEOPLE in an email: “It doesn’t surprise me at all that Mr. Trump would criticize someone else’s inappropriate sexual behavior and not address his own.” “From what I understand, people who are delusional and narcissistic lack self-awareness and have a need to lash out,” she added. Added another Trump accuser,Melinda McGillivray: “Donald is a complete hypocrite; he has the audacity to talk smack about other people when he’s the culprit himself.”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: Born Rolihlahla Dalibhunga Mandela on July 18, 1918 (he was nicknamed \"Nelson\" by a teacher), Mandela works in his parents' rural village of Qunu, South Africa, tilling fields and herding cattle with elders from the local Tembu tribe. After his father dies in 1930, the then-12-year-old is chosen as a future leader of the tribe because of his intelligence – life, however, has other plans. Mandela's activism starts early; in 1940 he's expelled from the University of Fort Hare after organizing a strike to protest limitations placed on the student council. He heads to Johannesburg, where he earns a job at a legal firm, starts working on his law degree and meets and marries his first wife, Evelyn Ntoko Mase, with whom he has four children. During his time in Johannesburg, Mandela meets 20-year-old social worker Nomzamo Winnie Madikizela. \"I cannot say for certain if there is such a thing as love at first sight,\" he wrote in his 1994 autobiography. \"But I do know that the moment I first glimpsed Winnie Nomzamo, I knew that I wanted to have her as my wife.\" He divorces Evelyn in 1955 and marries Winnie three years later, welcoming daughters with her in 1958 and 1960. In December 1956, Mandela and more than 150 other activists are arrested and charged with treason for staging strikes and protests in opposition to South Africa's apartheid (enforced racial segregation) laws. The trial lasts five years and ends in an acquittal. Mandela doesn't go quietly, however; he disappears underground and forms a military wing of the left-leaning African National Congress, helping to stage bombings on power plants, rail lines and other such targets when civilians aren't present. Eluding authorities for a while, he's eventually captured and, in June 1964, is convicted of sabotage and treason and sentenced to life in prison. In the beginning of his stay at Robben Island (left), a facility for political detainees, Mandela, prisoner 46664, does hard labor, breaking rocks into gravel for roads and completing tasks in the island's limestone quarry. After 18 years at Robben, Mandela is moved to the suburban Cape Town Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison in 1982, then to low-security Victor Verster Prison in the Western Cape in 1988. On Feb. 11, 1990, 71-year-old Mandela is freed from prison after serving 27 years. South African president F. W. de Klerk was in part responsible for the decision, after taking office and reversing the ban on the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid organizations. Mandela's release is broadcast live around the world. Three years after his release, Mandela receives a Nobel Peace Prize in conjunction with de Klerk, in recognition of their efforts to avoid a South African civil war, joining forces to calm fears and relieve racial tensions. There is, however,tension at home; Mandela and Winnie separate in 1992 and eventually divorce in 1996. On the four-year anniversary of his release from prison, Mandelareturns to Robben Islandfor a visit. In 1997, the facilitybecomes a museumand is visited over the years by stars likeBeyoncé, U2's Bono and Annie Lennox. Mandela becomes South Africa's first black president and is inaugurated on May 10, 1994. He serves one five-year term, working to transition from apartheid to a multicultural democracy, help social programs flourish and even get citizens to cheer for the country's rugby team (the inspiration for the 2009 filmInvictus). Unsurprisingly, Mandela becomes an inspiration and friend to many American celebrities, including King of PopMichael Jackson, who celebrates the leader's 78th year in 1996 by singing \"Happy Birthday\" and presenting him with a cake at his Johannesburg home. Another friend?Prince Charles, who joinsPrince Harry(not pictured), Mandela and the then-exploding Spice Girls at the presidential residence in Johannesburg prior to a 1997 concert. \"These are my heroes,\" Mandelasaid of the girl-power pop group. Other famous faces who became pals include Stevie Wonder and Danny Glover, who, along with Jackson, attend Mandela's 1998 wedding to third wife Graça Machel, widow of Mozambique president and African National Congress ally Samora Machel. Tied by their activism, Bono and Mandela enjoy a longtime friendship, with the U2 frontman even penning a song, \"46664,\" named after Mandela's prisoner number. But their time together is a little less heavy at the 2000 Laureus Sports Awards in Monaco, where they spread a simple message backstage. Inspired by Mandela,Oprah Winfreydecides to build the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls-South Africa. \"From the very beginning, I said to Nelson Mandela, 'I want to create a school for smart girls who will lead this country into glory,'\" the media mogulrecalled. The leader joins the talk-show host at the school's 2002 Agenda for Earth Turning Ceremony and is also present at the2007 opening. One of Mandela's great cultural moments comes in 2003, when he is honored in Cape Town at the star-studded AIDS awareness 46664 Concert, featuring performances by Queen, Peter Gabriel, U2, the Eurythmics andBeyoncé, an admirer. Mandela lost a son to AIDS in 2005 and worked to promote understanding about the disease after stepping down from the presidency in 1999. Mandela's 90th birthday dinner in Hyde Park, London, on June 25, 2008, is a who's-who of politicians from around the world. But it also includes some high-wattage Hollywood stars (and close friends), most notablyWill Smithand wife Jada Pinkett and Denzel Washington and wife Pauletta. After stepping down from office, Mandela curtails public appearances and focuses on family and his charity, theNelson Mandela Foundation. He also battles myriad health problems, including prostate cancer in 2001, an acute respiratory infection in 2011 and a lung infection in 2012 and 2013. But he manages to attend the closing ceremonies of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa,earning. During a goodwill trip to South Africa and Botswana in 2011, first ladyMichelle Obamaand daughters Sasha and Malia spend 20 minutes at home with Mandela, then 92, and his wife, following a visit to his foundation. Obamacalls the experience\"the most moving part\" of her trip abroad. Two years later, on Mandela's 95th birthday, the Obamasrelease a statementcongratulating the leader on the milestone and asking people to honor him through acts of service. Hundreds of peoplecongregate outside of Mandela's South Africa hospital roomon July 18, 2013, to celebrate the critically ill former president's 95th birthday – and his reportedly improving health. Sadly, it was announced on Dec. 5 thatMandela had passed away. \"Let us recall the values for which [he] fought. Let us reaffirm his vision of a society in which none is exploited, oppressed or possessed by another. Let us commit ourselves to strive together sparing neither strength nor courage to build a united, non-racial, non-sexiest, democratic and prosperous South Africa,\" the nation's president Jacob Zuma said when delivering the news.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"No"}]}

The 41-year-old golf pro was spotted at Dodgers Stadium for the World Series on Wednesday alongside rumored girlfriend Erica Herman — just two days before he’s scheduled to plead guilty to reckless driving in Jupiter, Florida. “They’re having fun,” a source close to the athlete tells PEOPLE of Woods and Herman. “He’s not looking for anything serious now. She’s cool and he likes her.” Woods and Herman both sported Dodgers’ jerseys and white hats as they watched the Houston Astros beat the hometown team 7-6 in Game 2. Last month, Herman attended the President’s Cup with Woods while wearing a “player spouse” credential, which is generally reserved for a spouse or significant other of the event’s player and captains,Golf.comreported. Herman served as general manager of The Woods, the golf star’s pop-up restaurant at February’s Genesis Open, according tothe social event’s website. (Woods also has a flagship restaurant in Jupiter, Florida.) Woods was initially expected to appear in court Wednesday, but the hearing was bumped to Friday, theAssociated Pressreports. The gold legend is scheduled to plead guilty to reckless driving at the hearing, and agree to enter a diversion program for intoxicated drivers, theAP also reports.

"},{"role":"user","content":"Article text: “It’s pretty spicy,” O'Donnell toldThe Daily Beast Rosie O'Donnellsays she's joined forces withDonald Trump's former lawyerMichael Cohento help the imprisoned attorney write a tell-all book about his years working for the president. Page Sixfirst reported the newsin March, and O'DonnelltoldThe Daily Beaston Friday that Cohen is almost done writing the book and \"hopes that it’ll be out before the [November] election.” “It’s pretty spicy,” O'Donnell, 58, told the outlet. The actress, comedian and talk show host says she reached out to Cohen in December on the same daythat Trump was impeachedover his Ukraine scandal. Cohen, now 53, was Trump's personal lawyer from 2006 until 2018 when he was sentenced to three years in prison for lying to a Senate committee and pleading guilty to making hush payments on behalf of the president to a number of women (including a $130,000 payment to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels) in order to keep the then-candidate's affairs from going public before the 2016 election. Cohen's guilty plea marked a dramatic reversal for someone who for years had been seen as an intensely loyal \"fixer\" for Trump. The president, who until then had publicly supported Cohen, quickly turned on him. Upon reporting to federal prison in May last year, Cohentold reportersthat \"there still remains much to be told, and I look forward to the day where I can share the truth.\" Now, O'Donnell — who famously feuded with Trump for years when he was a reality TV personality — says she's helping Cohen share the rest of his story. O'Donnell toldThe Daily Beastshe wrote him a letter the day Trump was impeached after she \"found [Cohen's] inmate number online.” Explaining the somewhat unusual pairing, she explained: “He always looked to me like someone from my neighborhood. He grew up on Long Island like I did, he’s a few years younger, and he reminds me of my brothers. I look at this guy and go, ‘How did he fall under the spell of that charlatan?’ ” RELATED:Rosie O'Donnell Slams Donald Trump for Previous Coronavirus Comments: 'He Is Such a Disappointment' In a letter to Cohen, O'Donnell said, she expressed remorse for the disbarred attorney. (Cohentold the courthe made the hush payments \"at the direction of a candidate,\" referring to Trump). The formerViewco-host also said she forgives Cohen. He was reportedly “so moved by the letter that he started crying\" and wrote O'Donnell back and, according to her, he said that “had been bothering him all this time, because he couldn’t believe all the things he did to everyone—including me—at Trump’s direction was now being done to him.\" After exchanging letters back-and-forth, O'Donnell said she visited Cohen in prison. \"I went there and I sat for six hours and talked to him,” she toldThe Daily Beast. “Michael and I talked a lot about how he got involved in Trump, how it’s a cult, and what role he played not only in Trump Inc. but also Trump’s own family, including how much he dealt with Barron and Melania.\" The presidentcalled Cohena \"bad lawyer and fraudster,\" last year. O'Donnell said that when Cohen told her that he was writing a book about working for Trump, she began offering her advice. “He told me what chapters he was doing in his book, and on my way home, I was writing about what had happened between us, and I gave him my breakdown of things that should be in chapters,” O’Donnell toldThe Daily Beast. “I said, ‘You should tellthisstory as a chapter, you should tellthisstory as a chapter.’ He’s in the midst of writing it, and is nearly done writing it, and hopes that it’ll be out before the election.” RELATED:New White House Press Secretary Previously Criticized Trump and Called His Comments 'Racist' There's no love lost between O'Donnell and Trump, dating back to when he called her a \"real loser\" in afiery interview with PEOPLEin December 2006 after O'Donnell criticized Trump on an episode ofThe Viewfor acting as a \"moral compass\" amid a controversy with then-Miss USA Tara Conner. \"Rosie will rue the words she said,\" Trump said at the time, adding, \"Rosie’s a loser. A real loser. I look forward to taking lots of money from my nice fat little Rosie.” In the years since, they've traded insults, with O'Donnell also criticizing his politics after he became the Republican Party leader. Sherecently blastedthe Trump administration's response to thenovel coronavirus pandemicin late March. \"He really is such a disappointment to so many people on so many different levels,” O'Donnellsaidof Trump's leadership throughout the pandemic, predicting in November that \"Americans will use their voices loud and strong\" and oust him from the White House. The coronavirus has killed nearly 80,000 in the U.S. so far,according to aNew York Timestracker. More than 1.3 million people have been infected in the U.S. “We need to — when this is over — to get through the reasons why things happened as they did, so we can make sure this never happens again,” O’Donnell said earlier this year. “We’re looking forward to a time when the nation has a leader they can trust, who doesn’t lie to them.” As information about thecoronavirus pandemicrapidly changes,PEOPLEis committed to providing the most recent data in our coverage.

(Some of Fox News' sources separately disputed part ofThe Atlantic's account, however.) “I do believe President Trump probably said this,\" McCain said Tuesday during a panel discussion onThe View's season premiere, after moderatorWhoopi Goldbergasked her for her thoughts. TheAtlanticstory, published last Thursday, cited several sources who said Trump, 74, also canceled a visit to a military cemetery near Paris during a 2018 trip because he was worried the rainy weather would mess up his hair. Though McCain, 35, said she had occasional issues with the use of anonymous sources, this reporting fit into a larger pattern. \"I just feel like every three-to-six months I’m having a similar conversation with you where there’s a report of President Trump disparaging troops or my family,” she said, referencing Trump's continued attacks against her late father, Sen.John McCain. \"This is familiar,\"The Viewco-host said. \"It’s familiar language that President Trump has used publicly.” While interviewing former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders during the show, who has said she never heard Trump make the reported statements, McCain again laid out the case for why she believes Trump made the remarks. \"The problem, as I said before, is the president has a consistent history and pattern of saying incendiary things about people like my father, about people like the Khan family, about people like Lt. Col. Vindman,\" McCain told Sanders, referencing other moments Trump insulted service members if he was displeased with them. McCain added: “If this charge had been leveled anonymously against any other politician, I think people would second-guess it. But because it’s about someone who has this kind of record of insulting veterans, people tend to believe it, which is why I think it has legs.\" RELATED:Meghan McCain Speaks of Longtime Family Friend Joe Biden’s 'Real Character' & How He Helped Her After Dad's Death Sanders again denied that Trump had called dead U.S. soldiers \"losers\" and \"suckers,\" saying that she has only witnessed \"the president’s respect and admiration for the men and women of our armed forces\" when traveling with Trump during her 22-month tenure as his White House spokesperson. McCain laterthankedSanders for doing the interview on Tuesday's show, which wasThe View's 24th season premiere, while noting they \"do not agree on every issue\" but she has \"respect for any person brave enough to join our panel and answer hard questions.\" Trump, who received a medical exemption from the Vietnam War for bone spurs, long attacked Sen. McCain, a former rival, even months after McCain died. “We’re not going to support that loser’s funeral,” Trump said of the late senator, according toThe Atlantic— which the president disputed, though he had previously called the Arizona lawmaker a \"loser.\" RELATED:Meghan McCain Says 'the Trumps Are Always Making My Mom Cry’ as She Talks Biden, 2020 & More TheViewco-host alludedduring an interviewback in April with Andy Cohen onWatch What Happens Livethat she would be voting for Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the 2020 election, given her family's friendship with Biden and Trump's repeated disparagement. McCain told Cohen onWWHLthat it \"shouldn’t be rocket science for people\" to figure out how she would vote. \"The Trumps are always making my mom cry and I just think politics is personal, too,\" McCain said then. \"I think character is really important in this moment — somebody who can tamp down fear and anger instead of making it worse. ”\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yes"}]}
